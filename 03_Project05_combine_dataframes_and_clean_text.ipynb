       "['\\'The Killing\\' has been overshadowed by Stanley Kubrick\\'s subsequent better known and better made movie masterpieces. Films like \\'Dr. Strangelove\\', \\'2001\\' and \\'A Clockwork Orange\\' are much more flamboyant and intellectually exciting than this early hard boiled crime thriller, but for my money it is still one of his most entertaining movies, and in its own modest way just as brilliant as his more talked about films. \\'The Killing\\' is still one of the greatest crime thrillers ever made, and one which influenced many film makers working in this genre, not the least of which Quentin Tarantino, who obviously worships this picture, and used its innovative structure as major inspiration for \\'Pulp Fiction\\'.  Kubrick wrote \\'The Killing\\'s script as well as directing, but made the smart move of asking \"the Dime Store Dostoevski\" Jim Thompson, author of pulp classics like \\'The Killer Inside Me\\' and \\'The Getaway\\' to supply the fresh and memorable dialogue. Sterling Hayden, who later achieved screen immmortality as General Jack D. Ripper in \\'Dr Strangelove\\', is perfect as ambitious small time crook Johnny Clay. He is surrounded by an almost flawless supporting cast. I qualified that because I wasn\\'t totally convinced by Coleen Gray who plays Johnny\\'s girlfriend. However she only really has one scene, and the rest of the cast more than makes up for her. Especially memorable are the mis-matched husband and wife played by Elisha Cook, Jr (\\'The House On Haunted Hill\\') and the sultry Marie Windsor (noir classic \\'Narrow Margin\\'). Their scenes together are simply terrific. Also noteworthy are the two scenes featuring legendary crazy Timothy Carey (\\'The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie\\'). Carey was one of the most extraordinary performers to set foot in front of a movie character, and is unforgettable. Kubrick obviously thought highly of him as he subsequently cast him in his anti-war classic \\'Paths Of Glory\\', a move which antagonised the movie\\'s star Kirk Douglas. Even if \\'The Killing\\' didn\\'t feature such a strong performance from Sterling Hayden it would be worth watching just to catch Cook, Windsor and Carey. On top of that you have some other great actors such as Vince Edwards, an innovative script, hip dialogue and some brilliant directorial touches. This exciting heist movie can\\'t be recommended highly enough, it\\'s a real treat for film buffs. A brilliant film that still packs a punch after almost fifty years, something I doubt you will be saying about many movies currently showing in today\\'s theatres. \\'The Killing\\' is a super cool suspense movie and not to be missed!',\n",
       " \"Stanley Kubrick's coming-out party from the mid '50s is a startlingly accurate prediction of film's future. By way of a non-linear narration and a few remarkably fresh transitions, Kubrick adds considerable weight and magnitude to a tangled heist tale and its focus on the crooks behind a slick, daring stickup of the local racetrack. Confused by the film's radical new approach to storytelling, test audiences hated the first cut, leading to studio meddling and an almost-complete disintegration of its marketing budget. Kubrick fought back, though, and with the obvious exception of a horribly heavy-handed deadpan narration, the finished product seems virtually untouched. Concerned mostly with the planning and hand-wringing before the big theft, The Killing tensely builds anticipation throughout before finally boiling over in a machine gun-paced robbery scene, terse payoff and all-too-brief elaboration on the major players' ultimate fates. Acceptably acted at best, the real stars of this picture are the complex plot and the harvest of fresh ideas going on behind the lens. A clear inspiration for Tarantino's big hits of the '90s, it's a daring and stylish major market debut for the famed director that hints at the lengths his development would ultimately take the medium.\",\n",
       " 'Director Stanley Kubrick is best known for \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" \"A Clockwork Orrange\" or \"The Shining\" but I always found this to be my favorite of his films. This is film noir at some of its best: a tight no-nonsense story with tragic consequences, some of the best film noir actors in the business and great cinematography, which looks even better on DVD.Sterling Hayden is the gang leader in this heist film and the big man was up to the task as he usually was in these kind of crime films. He wasn\\'t as rough a character as he was in \"Asphalt Jungle,\" but his role reminded me of that film.What made this movie so appealing to me were four very interesting character actors: Elisha Cook Jr., Marie Windsor, Kola Kwariani and Ted de Corsia. Few people had those loser-type film noir characters down pat as well as the tough-talking Windsor and the meek and wimpy Cook. They played a husband-and-wife team here: that\\'s film noir heaven!Kwariani plays a burley chess-playing wrestler who fights six cops at one time and Carey is a long-distance racist rifleman who talks through clenched-teeth and shoots a racehorse! As I said, some very interesting characters here. And, oh yeah.....for you over-55 readers, there\\'s Vince Edwards, alias Dr. Ben Casey of TV fame, as a Windsor\\'s young adulterer boyfriend trying to horn in on the money from the robbery.This film is full of surprises and always fun to watch.',\n",
       " 'There\\'s little to fault in Stanley Kubrick\\'s classic robbery tale.  The acting is first-rate with Marie Windsor, as Mrs. Peaty, a sarcastic stand-out. The story just pops off the screen - and at less than 90 minutes, there\\'s literally no filler.  I love the winding time line  (\"earlier that day\" etc.), which has been liberally utilized by Quentin Tarantino (Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs).  This film was made right before Kubrick\\'s WWI marvel, Paths of Glory, and his genius is apparent in both.  No wasted words or actions.  Love that last line!',\n",
       " \"At the age of 27, Stanley Kubrick's third film, The Killing, took Lionel White's hard-boiled, non-linear story of one man (Johnny Clay, with quick-talking, straightforward ease by Sterling Hayden) and his crew planning and tasking a race-track robbery. It's almost fifty years old, but by this time Kubrick intently defined his style, and somehow the film seems to have themes and characters that are identifiable (and recognizable) with any period. The supporting characters are as sharply drawn (and psychologically involving) if not more so than Johnny Clay. Driving us into this world of schemers shouldn't be dense, and as Kubrick passes by any pretense - and keeps the compositions and material entertaining and absorbing - and it allows a viewer a lot of promise on repeat viewings.While the story elements are similar to the sort of Kubrick-movie psychology (mostly dealing with men who are head deep in a rather existential crisis of what's against society), what's unique is how the craft is intuitive. On a low budget, and even with a cast that's very good if not excellent, everything is always assured in the style and turns grinding in the plot. I could watch this movie another two times (after three in the past two years or so) and still see shots so detailed yet with the tone that of the most inspired film-noirs. It's questionable as to where Kubrick got influence for some of the compositions, with usage of shadows and the dark (and light shades too), but whether or not it was some famous expressionist or from the 40's film-noirs, the mark of Kubrick uncurling as an artist is evident. One remark by some is that the narration is sometimes irritating, that the kind of B-movie police drama expository tone, and the information is too much. The voice is not my favorite part of the film, but the narration itself, the information, is an interesting mold in the film's structure. It adds on a layer to that existentialist subtext, as every description makes it sounds like the narrator's a reporter looking back on the past events with a (detached) objectivity. For me, this did make it a little much to concentrate on in the first viewing, however this is a film that demands un-thwarted attention for it's 83 minutes. If you turn away for too long, a piece of the puzzle will be out of sight. It's a great film, and it's gone on to inspire a flock of homagers and imitators in the last half century. A+\",\n",
       " \"Everything about this movie fascinates me.  Even the unexpected ending has a compelling and unique flavor to it.  Sure, it looks like many crime dramas of the 50's.  But we are talking about of a movie with a director of the prodigious talents of Stanley Kubrick.Sometimes you wonder which genre Kubrick could not have handled brilliantly. He seems to know exactly what to do in such a wide variety of movies...Crime, Drama, War, Surreal, Historical Epic, Science Fiction and Black Comedy.  My only wish would have been if Kubrick could have made MORE movies.  When he died, that left only Woody Allen as the only major director who is working as a pure artist in the film medium.  THE KILLING is filled with crime-noir touches that form an absorbing whole that is hard to beat.  The acting is top-notch, the scenes are set in gold taking from every crime movie and creating a whole that could not have been done so well by just any director - perhaps only Hitchcock could have pulled this off.  Then there's the jazzy score that underlines the action which punch and atmosphere that just curdles off the screen.Even if you're not a Kubrick fan (which might surprise many people when they find out he was the director) you will enjoy this movie.Right to the end...which I won't reveal...but has an inevitability written with classical balance and a submission to fate that leaves a wry smile on your face.Sterling Hayden is great in this role and he populates this character with just the right sort of mystery to keep you guessing until the end.Recommended without reservation.\",\n",
       " 'The story of a meticulously-planned race track hold-up is a stunner in every minute you watch it, and the film\\'s progressive use of a partly documentary style has often been acclaimed as uniquely supporting the dramatic goings-on. It definitely put a modern touch to the somewhat out-of-fashion film noir in 1956, but still greatly relied on its basic rules.A fine new note was the neat distinction between the gang\\'s members\\' motives, ranging from repaying underworld debts (De Corsia) and hope of offering a better life for his ill wife (Sawyer) to the vain ambition of pleasing his vamp wife by doing something special (Cook).Despite the film\\'s qualities, Kubrick\\'s treatment of the women\\'s rôles seems more than old-fashioned today. Women here are either the homely and sweet type (Coleen Gray) or the Bette-Davis-eyed and cherchez-la-femme type (Marie Windsor). Both are accordingly taller or smaller than their respective partners by a head.I should like to mention one of my favourite pans: that\\'s when the bald philosopher-catcher walks up to Joe Sawyer\\'s bar. Lucien Ballard\\'s camera follows him all across the crowded tote hall, a take which must have been very difficult to organize and shoot. Later, the scene is repeated with Sterling Hayden.This motion picture is also a monument for the great histrionic art of Elisha Cook, Jr., in a stand-out performance as the born loser. (German dubbing gives him the apt voice of Stan Laurel\\'s speaker Walter Bluhm.) This little man never just did his job in unnumerable supporting rôles but has rendered effective homage to the tragic figure on the silver screen more than any other (non-comical) character actor I can think of. Regardless of his versatility in lots of different films, his impersonations of a likeable man who is doomed to fail make him unforgettable: take his lethal parts in \"Phantom Lady\" (1944), \"Shane\" (1953) or the likes, the audience\\'s sympathy was always with this fine actor.',\n",
       " 'Stanley Kunbrick was still in his twenties when he made this film, yet his confidence and self-assurance are all over it.  It is a well-written story, co-written by Kubrick (based on a novel called \"A Clean Break\"), about a meticulously planned horetrack heist told from the point of view of the several people who were in on the plot.  Most of these guys weren\\'t professional criminals, but otherwise honest men who were down on their luck and needed a break.  They turned to this audacious plan in desperation, thinking they could do some real good in their lives with their share of the money.  I won\\'t give away the ending of course, but keep in mind this is a Kubrick film.  That\\'s all I say about that.Standouts include Sterling Hayden as the ringleader, Marie Windsor as a snide, manipulative woman, Elisha Cook as her milquetoasty husband, Timothy Carey, as creepy as ever, and Kola Kwariani, the thinking man\\'s Tor Johnson, as a chess expert/hired thug.Speaking of chess, this is the first movie I\\'ve ever seen with a scene taking place in a chess parlor.  Being from a provincial New England town, and not being a chess afficionado, I never knew such places existed.',\n",
       " \"Film noir in all its splendor, with a very dynamic rhythm, far from '2001, a space odyssey': an audacious burglary seems perfectly orchestrated and prepared with a surgical precision, until a minor glitch transforms a 'Symphonie fantastique' in a 'Descente d'Orphée aux enfers'.\",\n",
       " 'The formidably promising talent shown in \"Killer\\'s Kiss\" helped to secure for Stanley Kubrick studio backing for his next straight thriller, \"The Killing,\" made in 1956\\x85 This was a much more \"professional\" job than its forerunner\\x85 Kubrick had the casting of a bunch of actors so experienced in the \"character\" parts that as soon as they came into camera view you recognized them from a score of Hollywood movies\\x85 \"The Killing\" lacks for me the dimension of humanity of its predecessor\\x85 It reminded me of one of those documentaries that give you every conceivable fact with immaculate accuracy and leave you without the heart of the truth\\x85 This has something to do with the style of the storytelling\\x85. Once again there is a narrator; only instead of a lonely failure with blood in his veins, this one sounds like a \"March of Time\" commentator: loud, confident, detached\\x85 The film opens on the horses preparing for the off at the track and, even before the titles end, the dramatic music has started building the tension\\x85 One by one we are introduced to the characters as once again, we don\\'t know for a while what the plot is going to be; but this one uses the time to build the mystery and tension rather than to deepen the characters\\x85Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a convict just out from five years in Alcatraz, master-minding the two million dollar hold-up\\x85 He collects (how, we are never told) a bunch of flawed human beings to fit, like jigsaw pieces, into the intricacy of his plan\\x85 There\\'s an Irish barman, an amiable old book-keeper, a tough crooked cop; and there\\'s little George Peatty, played by Elisha Cook Jr \\x96 he of the bulging eyes and mobile mouth; here the incarnation of fear and uncertainty and in countless other Hollywood thrillers the personification of the staring-eyed boy killer...Kubrick plays tricks with time as his characters become caught in the plot\\x85 He takes each of them and plays his incident through to the next turn of the screw; then goes back to an earlier moment in time to see what somebody else was doing\\x85Even the incidental small parts have \"character\" stamped right through them\\x85 The marksman hired to shoot a winning racehorse to cause a diversion from the robbery is a war veteran with deformed speech\\x85 The old retired wrestler, who picks a fight with the police to create another diversion\\x85If \"Killer\\'s Kiss\" had one big dramatic set-piece, \"The Killing\" has a score of small dramatic touches to heighten the irony and the tension\\x85\"The Killing\" is one of the most skillful and entertaining suspense movies of the Fifties\\x85 It mesmerized like a ticking time bomb, and every few minutes, with sure skill, Kubrick recorded a new peak of suspense\\x85 And all with very little violence, again, though with the obligatory sudden death\\x85',\n",
       " \"Kubrick directed 15 odd movies in half a century (let's exclude Spartacus). His skills as an auteur may not have been recognized till Strangelove but they were on display in films like Lolita, Paths of Glory and of course The Killing, his first certified classic.The Killing is about an intricate race-track heist involving a group of non-professionals with clean records. The mastermind, Sterling Hayden, has however spent some time in prison. The unique thing for the time is the non-linear structure of the film - particularly the heist sequence. This was probably Hayden's finest role - yes, better than Jack D. Ripper of Strangelove or Altman's The Long Goodbye - as the doomed hero, Johnny Clay. He is very tall and physical and quite brilliant in this role. He is well-supported by an old favorite of mine from The Maltese Falcon, Elisha Cook Jr. whose venomous wife, Marie Windsor plays a femme fatale of sorts. There is also the cult favorite Timothy Carey as the person assigned to shoot Red Lightning. Reservoir Dogs, a cult film inspired by The Killing is dedicated to Carey.While The Killing is certainly noirish, it does not have the pure noir look - well, pretty much most of it is filmed in the daytime. In fact, if Kubrick was inspired, it would have been more by Hitchcock's tight pacing than by Chandler or Cain's hard-boiled dialog. The camera-work and editing are brilliant - for me even better than later Kubrick classics. Kubrick was forced to add a voice-over by the studio - something he really wasn't inclined towards. His ingenious solution was to have the VO not directly comment on the movie, but to add another layer to the films structure. It works! This film is not dated, although the Marie Windsor character is a bit one-dimensional and what is visible in the short length of the movie is the tight pacing.\",\n",
       " 'While people die violently in The Killing, the title comes from the thought of a financial killing. This film is a choreographed chess match - Kubrick had a lifelong passion for chess - with human pieces, where the gambit is a racetrack heist of two million dollars. The heist is brilliantly conceived. Johnny Clay, recently paroled, must have thought of nothing else in prison except this heist. The precision with which this scheme comes together is exquisite and absolutely flawless. There is one minor loose end during the heist itself when Marvin Unger shows up at the track drunk, contrary to instructions, but this is a red herring. The heist is brilliantly executed. It goes literally like clockwork, and that is the best, maybe the only, metaphor to describe it. It reminded me of a road rally where drivers had to be in certain positions at certain times. Clay recruits accomplices on the inside, track employees, who must play small, but critical parts, for the heist to work. Everyone does his job beautifully, the heist comes off with hardly a hitch. One accomplice is killed by police, but no one else - conspirator or bystander - gets hurt, and Clay gets away clean. No military operation was ever planned so minutely or executed so precisely. But, once Clay has the money, things come a-cropper. We know, of course, that the plan cannot succeed. Nefarious plans *never* succeed in film noir. It\\'s a rule. How this particular scheme came undone and was foiled seemed contrived and forced to me. Here is this exquisitely planned operation, flawlessly executed with military precision. And yet this scrupulously planned, perfectly timed attention to detail is tossed aside once Clay has the money. It\\'s almost like he expected to fail, or never counted on succeeding, like he thought, \"Okay, I\\'ve got two mil in small bills. Now, what do I do?\"But, that would be telling. How the perfect crime is foiled is the film\\'s climax, and its only weak moment. Sterling Hayden is brilliant as Johnny Clay. His precise, clipped, monotone delivery, almost like a newsman, is perfect here. The liner notes for my DVD said that the studio wanted Jack Palance or Victor Mature for the role, but Kubrick held firm. Either would have been good, but Hayden was brilliant. Marie Windsor is not one we would think of as a femme fatale, but she is also very good as the selfish, vain, scheming and very attractive wife of one of the co-conspirators played by Elisha Cooke, Jr. He married out of his league, and in film noir, that\\'s a guarantee for disaster. One of Kubrick\\'s best, and one of the best film noir\\'s ever done. A solid 8 out of 10',\n",
       " \"Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors of all time. He's made some of the greatest, thought provoking, controversial films of all time, and his style is out of this world. But before The Shining, before A Clockwork Orange, before 2001, before Dr. Strangelove, even before Spartacus, there was The Killing. It's a very good movie, but it's not one of Kubrick's best; and I was sort of expecting that. Rarely is a director's first movie his best, and even though it has some flaws, it's still a great movie. One problem I have with this movie is the unnecessary narration. I know that wasn't Kubrick's idea, but it's bad, and it's noticeable. It's actually pretty insulting to the audience's intelligence. I think Kubrick trusted his audience to be smart enough to follow the film, and I wish they would just remove it from the film. Another thing is that the movie feels very lopsided. The first half isn't bad, but the second half is definitely stronger. We get a lot of dialogue for the first half, and then we see the action in the second half. It's very well written, and it does keep my interest, but the scale is totally tipped. It's similar to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies. The first movie is non-stop action and wildly entertaining, and the second movie has very minimal action, and is mostly talking. Like I said, I love dialogue (especially when it's well written), but I wish it was more balanced with the action. So what's good about this movie? Well, the characters are great. You can tell Tarantino took a lot of inspiration from this movie when he made Reservoir Dogs. It's one of the first instances where the main characters are bad guys, they're very mean spirited, but you cheer for them anyway. Also, the ending is unique for the time. Just like I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang, the ending is just very haunting, and leaves you with a dark feeling. I think the best thing about this movie is the cinematography. Kubrick is known for his incredible cinematography, and it's really cool to see where it all started. You can just see the future genius that lies within. The Killing isn't a perfect movie, but it's still really good. For a low budget crime drama from the 1950s, it's amazing. And even though it's so low budget, you can still see that Kubrick style slowly growing. It may not be one of his best, and it does have its flaws, but it's still an engaging, dark, intelligent movie.\",\n",
       " \"The Killing is a film whose legacy can still be seen in many films today. This film is not only Stanley Kubrick's first acclaimed film, but it is also credited with inventing the concept of non-linear story telling for the film industry. Some recent films that have used this technique are Reservior Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Go, Wonderland and The Usual Suspects.The story deals with a motley crew of assorted criminals, inside men, and average joes just looking to get their hands on a large sum of money by stealing it from a racetrack. Sterling Hayden plays Johnny Clay, a hardened criminal who just finished serving a five-year prison sentence. He is the ringleader of the bunch who is determined to only go for the big heists from now on. He figures they can put you away for stealing ten dollars as easily as ten million, so what have you got to lose? The rest of the crew are mostly average people with average problems, as Clay explains early on. Some of them work at the track. One is a crooked cop. Two are hardened criminals added at the last minute to cause diversions. Everything has been timed and planned out to the letter. Of course in a film like this, things never go as planned. It wouldn't be entertaining if they did.The killing was made on a budget of well below half a million dollars, and it shows. The film looks cheap at times, but the story is more than enough to make you forgive its financial shortcomings. The acting is nothing too special. Hayden is strong and resourceful as Johnny Clay, but he's pretty wooden. Elisha Cook Jr. is pretty good as a hen-pecked husband who is taking part in the scheme to impress his high-maintenance wife. If this film were re-cast today, you'd have to think of William H. Macy to play this character. Timothy Carey is always memorable, even with such a small part like the one he has here. Such a strange-looking guy! He gets the most interesting assignment of all the people in on the heist.You can really tell this was made fifty years ago. Even though there are hardened criminals and low-lifes in nearly every scene, nobody ever says the F-word! There is, however, a fairly gory shootout in one scene which you normally didn't find in films back then. The killing was ahead of its time in more ways than one, I guess. Please be sure to check this one out! 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.\",\n",
       " '** spoilers **This is like a bad episode of Highway Patrol that was chopped up and reassembled.  Instead of a straightforward narrative, Kubrick keeps throwing in this corny narration-- \"forty minutes before that...\", \"Two weeks earlier...\"-- to cover up inexplicable jumps in the time line.  The story\\'s been scrambled for no apparent reason, and it just seems like inept storytelling, like listening to someone who keeps forgetting key details.Kubrick also used the narration to cover up holes in the exposition, like he didn\\'t want to go back and re-do scenes for clarity-- for example, that bit about how they were supposed to split up was mentioned just in time by the narrator, like it was an afterthought.  \"Oh yeah, they split up because it was part of the plan.  Sorry we didn\\'t mention it earlier.\"And there\\'s some major plot elements that aren\\'t explained either.  Why did they have to kill the horse?  None of the race fans who were \"distracted\" by it would have seen the robbery anyway.  And why was Timothy Carey\\'s character shot when he tried to drive out of the parking lot?  How did Sterling Hayden\\'s character get away with slugging a cop in the middle of a crowd?  How did a shotgun blast kill everyone except the person it was aimed at?  Why didn\\'t Johnny and his girlfriend take the train when the airline wouldn\\'t let them carry on the suitcase?  And that bit with having it fly open in the middle of the runway-- I could see that coming a mile off.  (I thought all the money was bundled up when he put it in the duffel bag-- what happened there?)Overall it was sloppy, contrived and poorly executed.  This is a first effort in every sense of the word, and belongs more properly to the canon of second rate cop shows of the fifties.  Fortunately, Kubrick seemed to have learned from the experience, but that\\'s about all you can say for it.',\n",
       " 'Stanley Kubrick co-wrote and directed this adaptation of Lionel White\\'s book \"Clean Break\" (a better title!) about a racetrack robbery gone horribly wrong. Film-noir is alternately exciting and heavy-hearted, with scenes that tend to plod and performances which aren\\'t terribly magnetic. Sterling Hayden excels as always, and Elisha Cook and Vince Edwards do well in character parts, but the other roles are disappointingly filled and the production is on the cheap side. Although Kubrick\\'s film garnered sterling notices in its time, it hasn\\'t aged well and is worth-seeing today only as a curio. **1/2 from ****',\n",
       " \"Stanley Kubrick is truly one of the most gifted directors of all time. He wasn't afraid to be boring(2001: a Space Odyssey) or critically bashed(The Shining) or risque and disturbing(A Clockwork Orange, Eyes Wide Shut).  He simply did his job: to provide a well made film with strong theme and meaning.  The Killing is definitely not Kubrick's best work.  It seems to me that Stan wasn't famous enough and too little known to make The Killing the way that he wanted to.  It was though, still pretty entertaining.  It has one of my favorite attributes that most movies don't even steer close to: a non-linear plot.  A non-linear plot is when scenes are put in non-chronilogical order, i.e. Pulp Fiction, Out of Sight, Fight Club, etc.  It makes the audience pay more attention and makes the plot seem more interesting and intricate.  In this movie, the plot wasn't way out of order, but it was enough to be conidered non-linear.     Another cool part of the movie was the heist itself.  It was very well planned and executed and obviously took time to think up.  The depressing climax and ending lean a lot towards the work of Hitchcock.  In fact, if this film had been in some parts been by Hitchcock, it would not have been too much of a surprise.     If you're in to classic, black and white crime dramas, then this movie is for you.\",\n",
       " '*SPOILERS* I really enjoyed \"The Killing2 but, like many, felt that the ending was fatally flawed. Johnny Clay appears to have every meticulous little detail in this robbery worked out to perfection, yet after the heist he removes the money from the secure baggage it is in and transfers it to a second-hand suitcase that he knows the locks to be faulty on. Over two million dollars in hard currency, yet Johnny can´t be bothered securing the suitcase!. Right Oh!. From the moment Kubrick´s camera focused on those faulty locks, the viewer knows instinctively that the whole shabang is going to be blown wide open. Two million dollars Johnny!. A new suitcase, a secure suitcase would maybe have set you back twenty dollars. And why didn´t you consider this aspect when you were making your meticulous and brilliantly executed robbery plans?. Shame on you.',\n",
       " 'This is seemingly the most exhilarating and uplifting movie I have ever seen. I go away from it strengthened and encouraged for the task or lonely road ahead. I know it would be wrong to identify with the protagonist, Johnny Clay, but I certainly sympathize with him. It may be indicative of some baseness in my character. I don\\'t know or much care after the movie is over. His terrible downfall is, oddly, an upper rather than a downer for me. My only difficulty is rather too much exhilaration, and I need to be brought back down to earth after the curtain falls maybe by some silliness that serves to remind me of the pointless futility of human endeavor. Oddly, \"The Killing\" does just the opposite. Go figure. The casting and narration and direction are superb. I\\'ve read a criticism that the actress playing Johnny\\'s girl friend is weak or miscast. I disagree. I think she\\'s perfect for the part and lends a great verisimilitude to it as well as other qualities that are crucial to the overall effect of the story on me. I don\\'t have a favorite movie anymore but I\\'d go see this one again if I were lucky enough to be able to see it in a theater, where it should be seen. The movies being made today usually ain\\'t worth mentionin\\'.',\n",
       " \"The Killing is a welcome improvement upon the disappointingly flat, Killer's Kiss. Some have gone as far to say that The Killing is the best film out of Stanley's entire filmography! Whilst, I'm inclined to strongly disagree with that statement, I still enjoyed The Killing (what's with Stanners and all this killing and killers?) for what it was. A stylish little crime thriller with a narrative which goes back and forth in time, which is reminiscent of Quentin's Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.A lot of noirs from the 50's can be extremely slow and, to be frank, boring! The Killing however didn't bore me for a second of its tight running time. In Stanley's later films, he tends to pad out the narrative, but here he keeps it economical and to the point. We begin at the beginning of the heist and then flip back to the group of men planning the robbery. It's a fairly unconventional storytelling method for the 50's, although Citizen Kane did attempt it first a decade or so earlier.Unlike Citizen Kane though, The Killing isn't boring. I enjoyed it's nice array of characters, particularly George and his acid-tongued wife. A large amount of the film was dedicated to this odd couple and the dialogue between them is especially witty and entertaining. It's a shame that some of the other guys didn't get as much screen-time, so I cared slightly less for them. It doesn't matter too much though, because The Killing is all about building up to the grand racetrack heist and it does a cracking job.Once we reach the heist we see it multiple times from everyone's different point of view. It's very engaging and clever to see how it all pans out and you're almost rooting for them to complete it cleanly. Some of it was also very well directed. I enjoyed the fight at the bar which was done in a realistic way and only in a few shots. I also liked the tense robbery itself where a character sports a clown mask not too dissimilar to the ones in the opening of The Dark Knight.In a fairly, yet satisfyingly contrived way, the film obviously pushes its moral that robbing is bad! Suffice to say that the characters meet a sticky way one way or another. I did find the ending a little too sudden and rushed, but overall The Killing is a pretty fine film. I loved its use of narrative and some of the characters were quite memorable too. It's far from Stanley Kubrick's best film, but it's a welcome leap forward from Killer's Kiss. I shall look forward to Paths of Glory.\",\n",
       " 'Stanley Kubrick\\'s \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb\" is by far his best movie ever.  However, my favorite Kubrick movie after that is \"Th killing\".  I think it\\'s better than \"2001: a space odyssey\", \"Paths of glory\", and \"Clockwork orange\".  Plus, he had everything right for the movie, especially the actors.  Stirling Hayden couldn\\'t have done a better job and no other actor could have been more convincing.  As usual, Kubrick\\'s name is all over the credits.  He directed, produced, and wrote the movie and did a great job in those three categories.  Of course, the script is original and helps the movie be great.  Johnny Clay (Stirling Hayden), an ex-con, decides to round up a few men to do a robbery.  It takes place in a race-track and the murder of a horse is included (that\\'s where the title came from).  Johnny finds all the men he needs and explains them how the robbery will go down.  So he has one man to shoot the horse from a parking lot.  He has another man to pick up the money once it was robbed, one man to create a diversion in the race-track, one man to open him the door to the money and finally, himself to rob the money and the man upstairs to hope everything goes the way it was planned.  But does the man upstairs really like them?  Hayden delivers a strong performance as well as the supporting cast does.  But it is Kubrick who, with his strong writing and directing, makes the movie a classic.  Once again, there are a few scenes where you can see how Kubrick was an avant-garde director and once again, the movie was over-looked at the Oscars getting absolutely no nominations. It\\'s a shame great movies like this one were often disregarded at the Oscars because if you ask me, if \"The killing\" had been nominated at the Oscars that year, it would have robbed every award including the best picture Oscar which was awarded to \"Around the world in 80 days\".  But the movie is still a gem.',\n",

       " \"(SOME SPOILERS) Stanley Kubrick's 1956 Film/Noir classic that plays with the clock in putting most of those involved in this robbery of a California racetrack in the same time-frame in a series of overlapping episodes.Planing to rob the tracks handle, money thats bet, as well as it's concession and tickets sales mastermind Johnny Clay, Sterling Hayden, plans the robbery to take place on the tracks biggest racing day when it holds it's most expensive feature race the $100,000.00 added Landstown Stakes. Working together with a number of track workers, a ticket seller and bartender, as well as a policemen to make the getaway with the cash without being noticed. The plan laid out by Johnny goes off almost without a hitch. Only one of the robbers Kikki Arcane ,Timothy Carey, was shot and killed by track police and all the rest got away. It's later the robbers meet up at their prearranged hideout, minus Johnny, things start to fall apart. As their all waiting for Johnny to come over with the $2,000,000.00 in cash that was taken in the robbery Val, Vince Edwards, and friend break into their place in order to rob them of the cash that they don't have. A gunfight breaks out with everyone there shot dead but the track ticket clerk George Peatty, Elisha Cook JR. who was in the other room and surprised them Val &amp; Co. by starting the gun fight.George badly wounded staggers out of the room to his car to go back home and deal with his two-timing wife Sherry, Marie Windsor, who was having an affair with Val, behind George's back. It was Saherry who tipped him off about the robbery and where the money is to be split between the robbers. As George leaves the house shot and bleeding Johnny pulls up with a laundry bag loaded with the $2,000,000.00 in cash to split up with the rest of the robbers. Seeing the police coming on the scene Johnny takes off to pick up his girlfriend Fay, Coleen Gray, and together drive down to the airport and get on a flight to Boston with the cash. George meanwhile goes home and confronts Sherry who at first though, when he opened the door,t that he was her lover Val and shoots her dead for double-crossing him and his fellow crooks.At the airport the final chapter of this film is played out with an ironic ending for both Johnny and Fay in their attempt to get away Scot-free with the track loot after everybody involved with it ended up dead. Like the domino effect in the movie that started with the shooting at the hideout between the robbers and Val &amp; friend the last piece to fall, after all the others fell, was just about to go down. The time sequences in the movie added at least twenty to the films final 85 minutes but instead of padding the movie to lengthen it's running time it actually enhanced it's story.\",\n",
       " 'In Paths of Glory, we see Kubrick\\'s \"coming out\"; the beginnings of his future aesthetic, with uncompromisingly straight-up dialog and a directness and unaffectedness of approach that made him an the undisputed master we now know him to be.In The Killing, we see the beginnings of his beginnings. The hints are there, but it\\'s too patchy to be able to say that the end product is well-knit. Some of the dialog is good. Attention to getting professionalism out of the actors/actresses lapses often enough to attract notice and mar the experience. I used to think that voice-over was invariably a cheap expedient; but upon refection, Kubrick\\'s voice-over work in Barry Lyndon is well, well implemented. The voice-over work in The Killing grates the moment you first hear it, and then it becomes a noir ghost come back to haunt you every time it kicks in.I think the story is trying to say something about \"best-laid-plans\", and that\\'s cool. But the set-up for the denouement doesn\\'t feel whole and right and good. Hayden\\'s character has 2 million bucks, but buys a cheap, cardboard suitcase from a rundown dive of a luggage shop to stow it in? Sorry, it just doesn\\'t compute, narratively speaking. I\\'m reminded of the ending of Manon of the Spring. Montand\\'s character finds out that his whole amoral/jaded outlook on life was the result of a letter lost in the mails, before the age of the telephone. You have to digest that plot twist in light of the technical limitations of the period in which it is set. The plot twist at the very end of The Killing doesn\\'t have this excuse. Even the similar, chaos-wrought twist at the end of No Country for Old Men works better because it is truly out of Anton Chighur\\'s control. Perhaps Kubrick might have more carefully considered how to engineer this to make Hayden\\'s character a true victim of circumstances.What\\'s good? Like I said, much of the dialog is good; some of it soars. Characterizations are generally good, even if the acting is a little stilted here and there. Of course, the cinematography is excellent. Oddly, the decision to make Hayden\\'s character\\'s love interest a last-minute, undeveloped character struck me a lot more honest than other crime movies where the plot development seems to be on its knees begging us to emotionally bond to criminals by over-developing the love interest angle. The Killing doesn\\'t do this, and in fact even goes the other way, by showing shallow, self-deceived romantic conceits and feints among the criminal set. That\\'s honest, and therefore good.It\\'s worth watching simply because it\\'s Kubrick. If it works better for you than it did for me, then good. If you find some of the same issues I did, then at least it informs your perspective on how a great director/artist like Kubrick grows. Personally, I\\'ve always enjoyed watching artists grow, even in retrospect.']"

       "'\\'The Killing\\' has been overshadowed by Stanley Kubrick\\'s subsequent better known and better made movie masterpieces. Films like \\'Dr. Strangelove\\', \\'2001\\' and \\'A Clockwork Orange\\' are much more flamboyant and intellectually exciting than this early hard boiled crime thriller, but for my money it is still one of his most entertaining movies, and in its own modest way just as brilliant as his more talked about films. \\'The Killing\\' is still one of the greatest crime thrillers ever made, and one which influenced many film makers working in this genre, not the least of which Quentin Tarantino, who obviously worships this picture, and used its innovative structure as major inspiration for \\'Pulp Fiction\\'.  Kubrick wrote \\'The Killing\\'s script as well as directing, but made the smart move of asking \"the Dime Store Dostoevski\" Jim Thompson, author of pulp classics like \\'The Killer Inside Me\\' and \\'The Getaway\\' to supply the fresh and memorable dialogue. Sterling Hayden, who later achieved screen immmortality as General Jack D. Ripper in \\'Dr Strangelove\\', is perfect as ambitious small time crook Johnny Clay. He is surrounded by an almost flawless supporting cast. I qualified that because I wasn\\'t totally convinced by Coleen Gray who plays Johnny\\'s girlfriend. However she only really has one scene, and the rest of the cast more than makes up for her. Especially memorable are the mis-matched husband and wife played by Elisha Cook, Jr (\\'The House On Haunted Hill\\') and the sultry Marie Windsor (noir classic \\'Narrow Margin\\'). Their scenes together are simply terrific. Also noteworthy are the two scenes featuring legendary crazy Timothy Carey (\\'The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie\\'). Carey was one of the most extraordinary performers to set foot in front of a movie character, and is unforgettable. Kubrick obviously thought highly of him as he subsequently cast him in his anti-war classic \\'Paths Of Glory\\', a move which antagonised the movie\\'s star Kirk Douglas. Even if \\'The Killing\\' didn\\'t feature such a strong performance from Sterling Hayden it would be worth watching just to catch Cook, Windsor and Carey. On top of that you have some other great actors such as Vince Edwards, an innovative script, hip dialogue and some brilliant directorial touches. This exciting heist movie can\\'t be recommended highly enough, it\\'s a real treat for film buffs. A brilliant film that still packs a punch after almost fifty years, something I doubt you will be saying about many movies currently showing in today\\'s theatres. \\'The Killing\\' is a super cool suspense movie and not to be missed! Stanley Kubrick\\'s coming-out party from the mid \\'50s is a startlingly accurate prediction of film\\'s future. By way of a non-linear narration and a few remarkably fresh transitions, Kubrick adds considerable weight and magnitude to a tangled heist tale and its focus on the crooks behind a slick, daring stickup of the local racetrack. Confused by the film\\'s radical new approach to storytelling, test audiences hated the first cut, leading to studio meddling and an almost-complete disintegration of its marketing budget. Kubrick fought back, though, and with the obvious exception of a horribly heavy-handed deadpan narration, the finished product seems virtually untouched. Concerned mostly with the planning and hand-wringing before the big theft, The Killing tensely builds anticipation throughout before finally boiling over in a machine gun-paced robbery scene, terse payoff and all-too-brief elaboration on the major players\\' ultimate fates. Acceptably acted at best, the real stars of this picture are the complex plot and the harvest of fresh ideas going on behind the lens. A clear inspiration for Tarantino\\'s big hits of the \\'90s, it\\'s a daring and stylish major market debut for the famed director that hints at the lengths his development would ultimately take the medium. Director Stanley Kubrick is best known for \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" \"A Clockwork Orrange\" or \"The Shining\" but I always found this to be my favorite of his films. This is film noir at some of its best: a tight no-nonsense story with tragic consequences, some of the best film noir actors in the business and great cinematography, which looks even better on DVD.Sterling Hayden is the gang leader in this heist film and the big man was up to the task as he usually was in these kind of crime films. He wasn\\'t as rough a character as he was in \"Asphalt Jungle,\" but his role reminded me of that film.What made this movie so appealing to me were four very interesting character actors: Elisha Cook Jr., Marie Windsor, Kola Kwariani and Ted de Corsia. Few people had those loser-type film noir characters down pat as well as the tough-talking Windsor and the meek and wimpy Cook. They played a husband-and-wife team here: that\\'s film noir heaven!Kwariani plays a burley chess-playing wrestler who fights six cops at one time and Carey is a long-distance racist rifleman who talks through clenched-teeth and shoots a racehorse! As I said, some very interesting characters here. And, oh yeah.....for you over-55 readers, there\\'s Vince Edwards, alias Dr. Ben Casey of TV fame, as a Windsor\\'s young adulterer boyfriend trying to horn in on the money from the robbery.This film is full of surprises and always fun to watch. There\\'s little to fault in Stanley Kubrick\\'s classic robbery tale.  The acting is first-rate with Marie Windsor, as Mrs. Peaty, a sarcastic stand-out. The story just pops off the screen - and at less than 90 minutes, there\\'s literally no filler.  I love the winding time line  (\"earlier that day\" etc.), which has been liberally utilized by Quentin Tarantino (Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs).  This film was made right before Kubrick\\'s WWI marvel, Paths of Glory, and his genius is apparent in both.  No wasted words or actions.  Love that last line! At the age of 27, Stanley Kubrick\\'s third film, The Killing, took Lionel White\\'s hard-boiled, non-linear story of one man (Johnny Clay, with quick-talking, straightforward ease by Sterling Hayden) and his crew planning and tasking a race-track robbery. It\\'s almost fifty years old, but by this time Kubrick intently defined his style, and somehow the film seems to have themes and characters that are identifiable (and recognizable) with any period. The supporting characters are as sharply drawn (and psychologically involving) if not more so than Johnny Clay. Driving us into this world of schemers shouldn\\'t be dense, and as Kubrick passes by any pretense - and keeps the compositions and material entertaining and absorbing - and it allows a viewer a lot of promise on repeat viewings.While the story elements are similar to the sort of Kubrick-movie psychology (mostly dealing with men who are head deep in a rather existential crisis of what\\'s against society), what\\'s unique is how the craft is intuitive. On a low budget, and even with a cast that\\'s very good if not excellent, everything is always assured in the style and turns grinding in the plot. I could watch this movie another two times (after three in the past two years or so) and still see shots so detailed yet with the tone that of the most inspired film-noirs. It\\'s questionable as to where Kubrick got influence for some of the compositions, with usage of shadows and the dark (and light shades too), but whether or not it was some famous expressionist or from the 40\\'s film-noirs, the mark of Kubrick uncurling as an artist is evident. One remark by some is that the narration is sometimes irritating, that the kind of B-movie police drama expository tone, and the information is too much. The voice is not my favorite part of the film, but the narration itself, the information, is an interesting mold in the film\\'s structure. It adds on a layer to that existentialist subtext, as every description makes it sounds like the narrator\\'s a reporter looking back on the past events with a (detached) objectivity. For me, this did make it a little much to concentrate on in the first viewing, however this is a film that demands un-thwarted attention for it\\'s 83 minutes. If you turn away for too long, a piece of the puzzle will be out of sight. It\\'s a great film, and it\\'s gone on to inspire a flock of homagers and imitators in the last half century. A+ Everything about this movie fascinates me.  Even the unexpected ending has a compelling and unique flavor to it.  Sure, it looks like many crime dramas of the 50\\'s.  But we are talking about of a movie with a director of the prodigious talents of Stanley Kubrick.Sometimes you wonder which genre Kubrick could not have handled brilliantly. He seems to know exactly what to do in such a wide variety of movies...Crime, Drama, War, Surreal, Historical Epic, Science Fiction and Black Comedy.  My only wish would have been if Kubrick could have made MORE movies.  When he died, that left only Woody Allen as the only major director who is working as a pure artist in the film medium.  THE KILLING is filled with crime-noir touches that form an absorbing whole that is hard to beat.  The acting is top-notch, the scenes are set in gold taking from every crime movie and creating a whole that could not have been done so well by just any director - perhaps only Hitchcock could have pulled this off.  Then there\\'s the jazzy score that underlines the action which punch and atmosphere that just curdles off the screen.Even if you\\'re not a Kubrick fan (which might surprise many people when they find out he was the director) you will enjoy this movie.Right to the end...which I won\\'t reveal...but has an inevitability written with classical balance and a submission to fate that leaves a wry smile on your face.Sterling Hayden is great in this role and he populates this character with just the right sort of mystery to keep you guessing until the end.Recommended without reservation. The story of a meticulously-planned race track hold-up is a stunner in every minute you watch it, and the film\\'s progressive use of a partly documentary style has often been acclaimed as uniquely supporting the dramatic goings-on. It definitely put a modern touch to the somewhat out-of-fashion film noir in 1956, but still greatly relied on its basic rules.A fine new note was the neat distinction between the gang\\'s members\\' motives, ranging from repaying underworld debts (De Corsia) and hope of offering a better life for his ill wife (Sawyer) to the vain ambition of pleasing his vamp wife by doing something special (Cook).Despite the film\\'s qualities, Kubrick\\'s treatment of the women\\'s rôles seems more than old-fashioned today. Women here are either the homely and sweet type (Coleen Gray) or the Bette-Davis-eyed and cherchez-la-femme type (Marie Windsor). Both are accordingly taller or smaller than their respective partners by a head.I should like to mention one of my favourite pans: that\\'s when the bald philosopher-catcher walks up to Joe Sawyer\\'s bar. Lucien Ballard\\'s camera follows him all across the crowded tote hall, a take which must have been very difficult to organize and shoot. Later, the scene is repeated with Sterling Hayden.This motion picture is also a monument for the great histrionic art of Elisha Cook, Jr., in a stand-out performance as the born loser. (German dubbing gives him the apt voice of Stan Laurel\\'s speaker Walter Bluhm.) This little man never just did his job in unnumerable supporting rôles but has rendered effective homage to the tragic figure on the silver screen more than any other (non-comical) character actor I can think of. Regardless of his versatility in lots of different films, his impersonations of a likeable man who is doomed to fail make him unforgettable: take his lethal parts in \"Phantom Lady\" (1944), \"Shane\" (1953) or the likes, the audience\\'s sympathy was always with this fine actor. Stanley Kunbrick was still in his twenties when he made this film, yet his confidence and self-assurance are all over it.  It is a well-written story, co-written by Kubrick (based on a novel called \"A Clean Break\"), about a meticulously planned horetrack heist told from the point of view of the several people who were in on the plot.  Most of these guys weren\\'t professional criminals, but otherwise honest men who were down on their luck and needed a break.  They turned to this audacious plan in desperation, thinking they could do some real good in their lives with their share of the money.  I won\\'t give away the ending of course, but keep in mind this is a Kubrick film.  That\\'s all I say about that.Standouts include Sterling Hayden as the ringleader, Marie Windsor as a snide, manipulative woman, Elisha Cook as her milquetoasty husband, Timothy Carey, as creepy as ever, and Kola Kwariani, the thinking man\\'s Tor Johnson, as a chess expert/hired thug.Speaking of chess, this is the first movie I\\'ve ever seen with a scene taking place in a chess parlor.  Being from a provincial New England town, and not being a chess afficionado, I never knew such places existed. Film noir in all its splendor, with a very dynamic rhythm, far from \\'2001, a space odyssey\\': an audacious burglary seems perfectly orchestrated and prepared with a surgical precision, until a minor glitch transforms a \\'Symphonie fantastique\\' in a \\'Descente d\\'Orphée aux enfers\\'. The formidably promising talent shown in \"Killer\\'s Kiss\" helped to secure for Stanley Kubrick studio backing for his next straight thriller, \"The Killing,\" made in 1956\\x85 This was a much more \"professional\" job than its forerunner\\x85 Kubrick had the casting of a bunch of actors so experienced in the \"character\" parts that as soon as they came into camera view you recognized them from a score of Hollywood movies\\x85 \"The Killing\" lacks for me the dimension of humanity of its predecessor\\x85 It reminded me of one of those documentaries that give you every conceivable fact with immaculate accuracy and leave you without the heart of the truth\\x85 This has something to do with the style of the storytelling\\x85. Once again there is a narrator; only instead of a lonely failure with blood in his veins, this one sounds like a \"March of Time\" commentator: loud, confident, detached\\x85 The film opens on the horses preparing for the off at the track and, even before the titles end, the dramatic music has started building the tension\\x85 One by one we are introduced to the characters as once again, we don\\'t know for a while what the plot is going to be; but this one uses the time to build the mystery and tension rather than to deepen the characters\\x85Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a convict just out from five years in Alcatraz, master-minding the two million dollar hold-up\\x85 He collects (how, we are never told) a bunch of flawed human beings to fit, like jigsaw pieces, into the intricacy of his plan\\x85 There\\'s an Irish barman, an amiable old book-keeper, a tough crooked cop; and there\\'s little George Peatty, played by Elisha Cook Jr \\x96 he of the bulging eyes and mobile mouth; here the incarnation of fear and uncertainty and in countless other Hollywood thrillers the personification of the staring-eyed boy killer...Kubrick plays tricks with time as his characters become caught in the plot\\x85 He takes each of them and plays his incident through to the next turn of the screw; then goes back to an earlier moment in time to see what somebody else was doing\\x85Even the incidental small parts have \"character\" stamped right through them\\x85 The marksman hired to shoot a winning racehorse to cause a diversion from the robbery is a war veteran with deformed speech\\x85 The old retired wrestler, who picks a fight with the police to create another diversion\\x85If \"Killer\\'s Kiss\" had one big dramatic set-piece, \"The Killing\" has a score of small dramatic touches to heighten the irony and the tension\\x85\"The Killing\" is one of the most skillful and entertaining suspense movies of the Fifties\\x85 It mesmerized like a ticking time bomb, and every few minutes, with sure skill, Kubrick recorded a new peak of suspense\\x85 And all with very little violence, again, though with the obligatory sudden death\\x85 Kubrick directed 15 odd movies in half a century (let\\'s exclude Spartacus). His skills as an auteur may not have been recognized till Strangelove but they were on display in films like Lolita, Paths of Glory and of course The Killing, his first certified classic.The Killing is about an intricate race-track heist involving a group of non-professionals with clean records. The mastermind, Sterling Hayden, has however spent some time in prison. The unique thing for the time is the non-linear structure of the film - particularly the heist sequence. This was probably Hayden\\'s finest role - yes, better than Jack D. Ripper of Strangelove or Altman\\'s The Long Goodbye - as the doomed hero, Johnny Clay. He is very tall and physical and quite brilliant in this role. He is well-supported by an old favorite of mine from The Maltese Falcon, Elisha Cook Jr. whose venomous wife, Marie Windsor plays a femme fatale of sorts. There is also the cult favorite Timothy Carey as the person assigned to shoot Red Lightning. Reservoir Dogs, a cult film inspired by The Killing is dedicated to Carey.While The Killing is certainly noirish, it does not have the pure noir look - well, pretty much most of it is filmed in the daytime. In fact, if Kubrick was inspired, it would have been more by Hitchcock\\'s tight pacing than by Chandler or Cain\\'s hard-boiled dialog. The camera-work and editing are brilliant - for me even better than later Kubrick classics. Kubrick was forced to add a voice-over by the studio - something he really wasn\\'t inclined towards. His ingenious solution was to have the VO not directly comment on the movie, but to add another layer to the films structure. It works! This film is not dated, although the Marie Windsor character is a bit one-dimensional and what is visible in the short length of the movie is the tight pacing. While people die violently in The Killing, the title comes from the thought of a financial killing. This film is a choreographed chess match - Kubrick had a lifelong passion for chess - with human pieces, where the gambit is a racetrack heist of two million dollars. The heist is brilliantly conceived. Johnny Clay, recently paroled, must have thought of nothing else in prison except this heist. The precision with which this scheme comes together is exquisite and absolutely flawless. There is one minor loose end during the heist itself when Marvin Unger shows up at the track drunk, contrary to instructions, but this is a red herring. The heist is brilliantly executed. It goes literally like clockwork, and that is the best, maybe the only, metaphor to describe it. It reminded me of a road rally where drivers had to be in certain positions at certain times. Clay recruits accomplices on the inside, track employees, who must play small, but critical parts, for the heist to work. Everyone does his job beautifully, the heist comes off with hardly a hitch. One accomplice is killed by police, but no one else - conspirator or bystander - gets hurt, and Clay gets away clean. No military operation was ever planned so minutely or executed so precisely. But, once Clay has the money, things come a-cropper. We know, of course, that the plan cannot succeed. Nefarious plans *never* succeed in film noir. It\\'s a rule. How this particular scheme came undone and was foiled seemed contrived and forced to me. Here is this exquisitely planned operation, flawlessly executed with military precision. And yet this scrupulously planned, perfectly timed attention to detail is tossed aside once Clay has the money. It\\'s almost like he expected to fail, or never counted on succeeding, like he thought, \"Okay, I\\'ve got two mil in small bills. Now, what do I do?\"But, that would be telling. How the perfect crime is foiled is the film\\'s climax, and its only weak moment. Sterling Hayden is brilliant as Johnny Clay. His precise, clipped, monotone delivery, almost like a newsman, is perfect here. The liner notes for my DVD said that the studio wanted Jack Palance or Victor Mature for the role, but Kubrick held firm. Either would have been good, but Hayden was brilliant. Marie Windsor is not one we would think of as a femme fatale, but she is also very good as the selfish, vain, scheming and very attractive wife of one of the co-conspirators played by Elisha Cooke, Jr. He married out of his league, and in film noir, that\\'s a guarantee for disaster. One of Kubrick\\'s best, and one of the best film noir\\'s ever done. A solid 8 out of 10 Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors of all time. He\\'s made some of the greatest, thought provoking, controversial films of all time, and his style is out of this world. But before The Shining, before A Clockwork Orange, before 2001, before Dr. Strangelove, even before Spartacus, there was The Killing. It\\'s a very good movie, but it\\'s not one of Kubrick\\'s best; and I was sort of expecting that. Rarely is a director\\'s first movie his best, and even though it has some flaws, it\\'s still a great movie. One problem I have with this movie is the unnecessary narration. I know that wasn\\'t Kubrick\\'s idea, but it\\'s bad, and it\\'s noticeable. It\\'s actually pretty insulting to the audience\\'s intelligence. I think Kubrick trusted his audience to be smart enough to follow the film, and I wish they would just remove it from the film. Another thing is that the movie feels very lopsided. The first half isn\\'t bad, but the second half is definitely stronger. We get a lot of dialogue for the first half, and then we see the action in the second half. It\\'s very well written, and it does keep my interest, but the scale is totally tipped. It\\'s similar to Quentin Tarantino\\'s Kill Bill movies. The first movie is non-stop action and wildly entertaining, and the second movie has very minimal action, and is mostly talking. Like I said, I love dialogue (especially when it\\'s well written), but I wish it was more balanced with the action. So what\\'s good about this movie? Well, the characters are great. You can tell Tarantino took a lot of inspiration from this movie when he made Reservoir Dogs. It\\'s one of the first instances where the main characters are bad guys, they\\'re very mean spirited, but you cheer for them anyway. Also, the ending is unique for the time. Just like I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang, the ending is just very haunting, and leaves you with a dark feeling. I think the best thing about this movie is the cinematography. Kubrick is known for his incredible cinematography, and it\\'s really cool to see where it all started. You can just see the future genius that lies within. The Killing isn\\'t a perfect movie, but it\\'s still really good. For a low budget crime drama from the 1950s, it\\'s amazing. And even though it\\'s so low budget, you can still see that Kubrick style slowly growing. It may not be one of his best, and it does have its flaws, but it\\'s still an engaging, dark, intelligent movie. The Killing is a film whose legacy can still be seen in many films today. This film is not only Stanley Kubrick\\'s first acclaimed film, but it is also credited with inventing the concept of non-linear story telling for the film industry. Some recent films that have used this technique are Reservior Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Go, Wonderland and The Usual Suspects.The story deals with a motley crew of assorted criminals, inside men, and average joes just looking to get their hands on a large sum of money by stealing it from a racetrack. Sterling Hayden plays Johnny Clay, a hardened criminal who just finished serving a five-year prison sentence. He is the ringleader of the bunch who is determined to only go for the big heists from now on. He figures they can put you away for stealing ten dollars as easily as ten million, so what have you got to lose? The rest of the crew are mostly average people with average problems, as Clay explains early on. Some of them work at the track. One is a crooked cop. Two are hardened criminals added at the last minute to cause diversions. Everything has been timed and planned out to the letter. Of course in a film like this, things never go as planned. It wouldn\\'t be entertaining if they did.The killing was made on a budget of well below half a million dollars, and it shows. The film looks cheap at times, but the story is more than enough to make you forgive its financial shortcomings. The acting is nothing too special. Hayden is strong and resourceful as Johnny Clay, but he\\'s pretty wooden. Elisha Cook Jr. is pretty good as a hen-pecked husband who is taking part in the scheme to impress his high-maintenance wife. If this film were re-cast today, you\\'d have to think of William H. Macy to play this character. Timothy Carey is always memorable, even with such a small part like the one he has here. Such a strange-looking guy! He gets the most interesting assignment of all the people in on the heist.You can really tell this was made fifty years ago. Even though there are hardened criminals and low-lifes in nearly every scene, nobody ever says the F-word! There is, however, a fairly gory shootout in one scene which you normally didn\\'t find in films back then. The killing was ahead of its time in more ways than one, I guess. Please be sure to check this one out! 8 of 10 stars.The Hound. ** spoilers **This is like a bad episode of Highway Patrol that was chopped up and reassembled.  Instead of a straightforward narrative, Kubrick keeps throwing in this corny narration-- \"forty minutes before that...\", \"Two weeks earlier...\"-- to cover up inexplicable jumps in the time line.  The story\\'s been scrambled for no apparent reason, and it just seems like inept storytelling, like listening to someone who keeps forgetting key details.Kubrick also used the narration to cover up holes in the exposition, like he didn\\'t want to go back and re-do scenes for clarity-- for example, that bit about how they were supposed to split up was mentioned just in time by the narrator, like it was an afterthought.  \"Oh yeah, they split up because it was part of the plan.  Sorry we didn\\'t mention it earlier.\"And there\\'s some major plot elements that aren\\'t explained either.  Why did they have to kill the horse?  None of the race fans who were \"distracted\" by it would have seen the robbery anyway.  And why was Timothy Carey\\'s character shot when he tried to drive out of the parking lot?  How did Sterling Hayden\\'s character get away with slugging a cop in the middle of a crowd?  How did a shotgun blast kill everyone except the person it was aimed at?  Why didn\\'t Johnny and his girlfriend take the train when the airline wouldn\\'t let them carry on the suitcase?  And that bit with having it fly open in the middle of the runway-- I could see that coming a mile off.  (I thought all the money was bundled up when he put it in the duffel bag-- what happened there?)Overall it was sloppy, contrived and poorly executed.  This is a first effort in every sense of the word, and belongs more properly to the canon of second rate cop shows of the fifties.  Fortunately, Kubrick seemed to have learned from the experience, but that\\'s about all you can say for it. Stanley Kubrick co-wrote and directed this adaptation of Lionel White\\'s book \"Clean Break\" (a better title!) about a racetrack robbery gone horribly wrong. Film-noir is alternately exciting and heavy-hearted, with scenes that tend to plod and performances which aren\\'t terribly magnetic. Sterling Hayden excels as always, and Elisha Cook and Vince Edwards do well in character parts, but the other roles are disappointingly filled and the production is on the cheap side. Although Kubrick\\'s film garnered sterling notices in its time, it hasn\\'t aged well and is worth-seeing today only as a curio. **1/2 from **** Stanley Kubrick is truly one of the most gifted directors of all time. He wasn\\'t afraid to be boring(2001: a Space Odyssey) or critically bashed(The Shining) or risque and disturbing(A Clockwork Orange, Eyes Wide Shut).  He simply did his job: to provide a well made film with strong theme and meaning.  The Killing is definitely not Kubrick\\'s best work.  It seems to me that Stan wasn\\'t famous enough and too little known to make The Killing the way that he wanted to.  It was though, still pretty entertaining.  It has one of my favorite attributes that most movies don\\'t even steer close to: a non-linear plot.  A non-linear plot is when scenes are put in non-chronilogical order, i.e. Pulp Fiction, Out of Sight, Fight Club, etc.  It makes the audience pay more attention and makes the plot seem more interesting and intricate.  In this movie, the plot wasn\\'t way out of order, but it was enough to be conidered non-linear.     Another cool part of the movie was the heist itself.  It was very well planned and executed and obviously took time to think up.  The depressing climax and ending lean a lot towards the work of Hitchcock.  In fact, if this film had been in some parts been by Hitchcock, it would not have been too much of a surprise.     If you\\'re in to classic, black and white crime dramas, then this movie is for you. *SPOILERS* I really enjoyed \"The Killing2 but, like many, felt that the ending was fatally flawed. Johnny Clay appears to have every meticulous little detail in this robbery worked out to perfection, yet after the heist he removes the money from the secure baggage it is in and transfers it to a second-hand suitcase that he knows the locks to be faulty on. Over two million dollars in hard currency, yet Johnny can´t be bothered securing the suitcase!. Right Oh!. From the moment Kubrick´s camera focused on those faulty locks, the viewer knows instinctively that the whole shabang is going to be blown wide open. Two million dollars Johnny!. A new suitcase, a secure suitcase would maybe have set you back twenty dollars. And why didn´t you consider this aspect when you were making your meticulous and brilliantly executed robbery plans?. Shame on you. This is seemingly the most exhilarating and uplifting movie I have ever seen. I go away from it strengthened and encouraged for the task or lonely road ahead. I know it would be wrong to identify with the protagonist, Johnny Clay, but I certainly sympathize with him. It may be indicative of some baseness in my character. I don\\'t know or much care after the movie is over. His terrible downfall is, oddly, an upper rather than a downer for me. My only difficulty is rather too much exhilaration, and I need to be brought back down to earth after the curtain falls maybe by some silliness that serves to remind me of the pointless futility of human endeavor. Oddly, \"The Killing\" does just the opposite. Go figure. The casting and narration and direction are superb. I\\'ve read a criticism that the actress playing Johnny\\'s girl friend is weak or miscast. I disagree. I think she\\'s perfect for the part and lends a great verisimilitude to it as well as other qualities that are crucial to the overall effect of the story on me. I don\\'t have a favorite movie anymore but I\\'d go see this one again if I were lucky enough to be able to see it in a theater, where it should be seen. The movies being made today usually ain\\'t worth mentionin\\'. The Killing is a welcome improvement upon the disappointingly flat, Killer\\'s Kiss. Some have gone as far to say that The Killing is the best film out of Stanley\\'s entire filmography! Whilst, I\\'m inclined to strongly disagree with that statement, I still enjoyed The Killing (what\\'s with Stanners and all this killing and killers?) for what it was. A stylish little crime thriller with a narrative which goes back and forth in time, which is reminiscent of Quentin\\'s Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.A lot of noirs from the 50\\'s can be extremely slow and, to be frank, boring! The Killing however didn\\'t bore me for a second of its tight running time. In Stanley\\'s later films, he tends to pad out the narrative, but here he keeps it economical and to the point. We begin at the beginning of the heist and then flip back to the group of men planning the robbery. It\\'s a fairly unconventional storytelling method for the 50\\'s, although Citizen Kane did attempt it first a decade or so earlier.Unlike Citizen Kane though, The Killing isn\\'t boring. I enjoyed it\\'s nice array of characters, particularly George and his acid-tongued wife. A large amount of the film was dedicated to this odd couple and the dialogue between them is especially witty and entertaining. It\\'s a shame that some of the other guys didn\\'t get as much screen-time, so I cared slightly less for them. It doesn\\'t matter too much though, because The Killing is all about building up to the grand racetrack heist and it does a cracking job.Once we reach the heist we see it multiple times from everyone\\'s different point of view. It\\'s very engaging and clever to see how it all pans out and you\\'re almost rooting for them to complete it cleanly. Some of it was also very well directed. I enjoyed the fight at the bar which was done in a realistic way and only in a few shots. I also liked the tense robbery itself where a character sports a clown mask not too dissimilar to the ones in the opening of The Dark Knight.In a fairly, yet satisfyingly contrived way, the film obviously pushes its moral that robbing is bad! Suffice to say that the characters meet a sticky way one way or another. I did find the ending a little too sudden and rushed, but overall The Killing is a pretty fine film. I loved its use of narrative and some of the characters were quite memorable too. It\\'s far from Stanley Kubrick\\'s best film, but it\\'s a welcome leap forward from Killer\\'s Kiss. I shall look forward to Paths of Glory. Stanley Kubrick\\'s \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb\" is by far his best movie ever.  However, my favorite Kubrick movie after that is \"Th killing\".  I think it\\'s better than \"2001: a space odyssey\", \"Paths of glory\", and \"Clockwork orange\".  Plus, he had everything right for the movie, especially the actors.  Stirling Hayden couldn\\'t have done a better job and no other actor could have been more convincing.  As usual, Kubrick\\'s name is all over the credits.  He directed, produced, and wrote the movie and did a great job in those three categories.  Of course, the script is original and helps the movie be great.  Johnny Clay (Stirling Hayden), an ex-con, decides to round up a few men to do a robbery.  It takes place in a race-track and the murder of a horse is included (that\\'s where the title came from).  Johnny finds all the men he needs and explains them how the robbery will go down.  So he has one man to shoot the horse from a parking lot.  He has another man to pick up the money once it was robbed, one man to create a diversion in the race-track, one man to open him the door to the money and finally, himself to rob the money and the man upstairs to hope everything goes the way it was planned.  But does the man upstairs really like them?  Hayden delivers a strong performance as well as the supporting cast does.  But it is Kubrick who, with his strong writing and directing, makes the movie a classic.  Once again, there are a few scenes where you can see how Kubrick was an avant-garde director and once again, the movie was over-looked at the Oscars getting absolutely no nominations. It\\'s a shame great movies like this one were often disregarded at the Oscars because if you ask me, if \"The killing\" had been nominated at the Oscars that year, it would have robbed every award including the best picture Oscar which was awarded to \"Around the world in 80 days\".  But the movie is still a gem. An ex-convict named Jhonny Clay (Sterling Hayden) with a beautiful girlfriend (Coleen Gray) emerges from his forced retirement in prison and assembles a gang for one final rip-off of race-track cash . The misfit group is formed by a cop (Ted DeCorsia) , a cashier (Elisah Cook Jr) with an ambitious fiancée named Sheerie (Mary Windsor) , a barman (Joe Sawyer) and an old man named Unger (J.C. Flippen) . Meanwhile, the mean Sheerie gives his lover(Vince Edwards) details about the planned heist . Besides , Johnny hires a marksman (Timothy Carey) and a bouncing man (Maurice) to pull off the race-track robbing though it results to be a total disaster .This classic noir film -based on the novel ¨Clean break¨ by Lionel White- contains suspense , action , sharp-edged thrilling scenes and excellent performance . The movie is slickly narrated in original manner by means of several flashbacks , puzzles , jigsaw and off-voice . A very realistic plot with ordinary people planning a suspenseful heist . The picture displays usual elements noir cinema like the fatalism and tragic fate ; loser characters ; a magnificent black and white cinematography in lights and shades and the ¨Femme Fatale¨, marvellously incarnated by an avaricious Mary Windsor , she\\'s the first among equals from extraordinary cast . The cluster of magnificent players is formed by an awesome bunch of Hollywood\\'s best secondary stars . Atmospheric cinematography by Lucien Ballard and appropriate musical score by Gerard Fried . The motion picture was excellently directed by Stanley Kubrick , he realized a riveting piece of film-making . A superb cast ,relentless intrigue and fascinating thriller make this one of the best crime movies ever made . Rating : Above average and highly acclaimed film . Characters made by the book, no one steps out of the row. A little too theatrical, but that was the time. Seen today the heist is too simple (no cameras, access cards, sensors). (SOME SPOILERS) Stanley Kubrick\\'s 1956 Film/Noir classic that plays with the clock in putting most of those involved in this robbery of a California racetrack in the same time-frame in a series of overlapping episodes.Planing to rob the tracks handle, money thats bet, as well as it\\'s concession and tickets sales mastermind Johnny Clay, Sterling Hayden, plans the robbery to take place on the tracks biggest racing day when it holds it\\'s most expensive feature race the $100,000.00 added Landstown Stakes. Working together with a number of track workers, a ticket seller and bartender, as well as a policemen to make the getaway with the cash without being noticed. The plan laid out by Johnny goes off almost without a hitch. Only one of the robbers Kikki Arcane ,Timothy Carey, was shot and killed by track police and all the rest got away. It\\'s later the robbers meet up at their prearranged hideout, minus Johnny, things start to fall apart. As their all waiting for Johnny to come over with the $2,000,000.00 in cash that was taken in the robbery Val, Vince Edwards, and friend break into their place in order to rob them of the cash that they don\\'t have. A gunfight breaks out with everyone there shot dead but the track ticket clerk George Peatty, Elisha Cook JR. who was in the other room and surprised them Val &amp; Co. by starting the gun fight.George badly wounded staggers out of the room to his car to go back home and deal with his two-timing wife Sherry, Marie Windsor, who was having an affair with Val, behind George\\'s back. It was Saherry who tipped him off about the robbery and where the money is to be split between the robbers. As George leaves the house shot and bleeding Johnny pulls up with a laundry bag loaded with the $2,000,000.00 in cash to split up with the rest of the robbers. Seeing the police coming on the scene Johnny takes off to pick up his girlfriend Fay, Coleen Gray, and together drive down to the airport and get on a flight to Boston with the cash. George meanwhile goes home and confronts Sherry who at first though, when he opened the door,t that he was her lover Val and shoots her dead for double-crossing him and his fellow crooks.At the airport the final chapter of this film is played out with an ironic ending for both Johnny and Fay in their attempt to get away Scot-free with the track loot after everybody involved with it ended up dead. Like the domino effect in the movie that started with the shooting at the hideout between the robbers and Val &amp; friend the last piece to fall, after all the others fell, was just about to go down. The time sequences in the movie added at least twenty to the films final 85 minutes but instead of padding the movie to lengthen it\\'s running time it actually enhanced it\\'s story. In Paths of Glory, we see Kubrick\\'s \"coming out\"; the beginnings of his future aesthetic, with uncompromisingly straight-up dialog and a directness and unaffectedness of approach that made him an the undisputed master we now know him to be.In The Killing, we see the beginnings of his beginnings. The hints are there, but it\\'s too patchy to be able to say that the end product is well-knit. Some of the dialog is good. Attention to getting professionalism out of the actors/actresses lapses often enough to attract notice and mar the experience. I used to think that voice-over was invariably a cheap expedient; but upon refection, Kubrick\\'s voice-over work in Barry Lyndon is well, well implemented. The voice-over work in The Killing grates the moment you first hear it, and then it becomes a noir ghost come back to haunt you every time it kicks in.I think the story is trying to say something about \"best-laid-plans\", and that\\'s cool. But the set-up for the denouement doesn\\'t feel whole and right and good. Hayden\\'s character has 2 million bucks, but buys a cheap, cardboard suitcase from a rundown dive of a luggage shop to stow it in? Sorry, it just doesn\\'t compute, narratively speaking. I\\'m reminded of the ending of Manon of the Spring. Montand\\'s character finds out that his whole amoral/jaded outlook on life was the result of a letter lost in the mails, before the age of the telephone. You have to digest that plot twist in light of the technical limitations of the period in which it is set. The plot twist at the very end of The Killing doesn\\'t have this excuse. Even the similar, chaos-wrought twist at the end of No Country for Old Men works better because it is truly out of Anton Chighur\\'s control. Perhaps Kubrick might have more carefully considered how to engineer this to make Hayden\\'s character a true victim of circumstances.What\\'s good? Like I said, much of the dialog is good; some of it soars. Characterizations are generally good, even if the acting is a little stilted here and there. Of course, the cinematography is excellent. Oddly, the decision to make Hayden\\'s character\\'s love interest a last-minute, undeveloped character struck me a lot more honest than other crime movies where the plot development seems to be on its knees begging us to emotionally bond to criminals by over-developing the love interest angle. The Killing doesn\\'t do this, and in fact even goes the other way, by showing shallow, self-deceived romantic conceits and feints among the criminal set. That\\'s honest, and therefore good.It\\'s worth watching simply because it\\'s Kubrick. If it works better for you than it did for me, then good. If you find some of the same issues I did, then at least it informs your perspective on how a great director/artist like Kubrick grows. Personally, I\\'ve always enjoyed watching artists grow, even in retrospect.'"

       "['This film is not a feature film.  For a start, it is not feature length, also, it is not shot on film.  More importantly, it does not have what feature films have these days: star actors, special effects, exotic locations, explosions.  Instead, seeing B.W.P. is seeing something else that a cinema can be: a place where people can share an intimate experience created by a few people on a tight budget.  I would be glad of its success if only for that reason.The first section of the film appears at first to be amateurish and slow. In fact, it is very deft, and very efficient at what it does.  It tells the audience everything it needs to know about the characters and situation, and nothing more.  Also, it gets the audience into the habit of viewing the film\\'s format: alternating between black and white (very grainy and poorly focussed) film, and the washed out colours of shaky pixilated video.  The film makers managed to set up a rationale for why the film is so cheaply made.  Three people hike into the woods for a few days to shoot a documentary, with borrowed equipment, and are in the habit of videoing everything for the hell of it.   They cannot carry tripods, steadicams, dollies, large lighting rigs, or the like, so everything we see is lit either by raw daylight, or by a single light fixed to the camera, which illuminates just what is within a few feet of the lens.  The film creates its own excuse to be cheap.  This is intelligent.The acting and script are both excellent.  The well-cast actors are presumably playing pretty-much themselves, and are convincingly naturalistic, and neither too likeable or too dislikeable.  The slow route into hysteria is well documented.  Rather than simply having a character say \"We\\'re lost!\", we see many scenes which show the trio getting more and more hopelessly lost, and more annoyed with each other for this.  By the time they are thoroughly lost, the audience shares the despair.My friend and I, after seeing it, both felt a little sick.  I put this down to my having been tense for a hour, he put it down more to motion sickness. The jerky, badly-framed camerawork is hard on the eye and stomach, but I applaud the director for its uncompromising use.  Similarly, no compromise is made with the dialogue.  Some of it is very quiet and must be listened for, some is technical jargon, which is left realisticly unexplained.One of the great strengths and weaknesses of the film is the editing.  It is good in that it does much to heighten the tension, with many key moments lasting just a little too long for comfort.  Each time the characters find something nasty, the viewer is made to want the editor to cut soon to the next scene, and the fact that he doesn\\'t adds to the sense of being trapped, as the characters are.  The problem with this, though, is that one is left wondering about the motives of the fictional editor.  In truth, of course, the film is edited to create these effects, and to entertain, but the film\\'s rationale is that these are the rushes of a documentary put together posthumously by someone other than the film\\'s original creator.  Why, then, would an editor piecing together such footage, edit for dramatic effect rather than for clarity?  Why would he keep cutting back and forth from the video footage to the film footage, when neither shows any more information than the other?The film is stark.  After one simple caption at the start, all that follows is the \"rushes\".  I wonder if the film might not have been improved with an introductory section which documented how the rushes were found and edited. A programme was made for television which did this.  Perhaps a portion of this might have been added to the film, making it more complete, and more believable (and proper feature length).While I applaud the fact that young original film-makers have managed to create a mainstream hit out of a simple idea, well-handled.  I dread the possible avalanche of inferior copies which may come.Most horror films these days are created not for the audience, but for the makers.  The departments of special effects, make-up, model-making, animation and so forth all try hard to show potential future employers what they can do.  The result is that nothing is left for the audience to do, since everything can be seen and heard, and the viewer\\'s imagination can be switched off.  Today, it is possible to see pigs fly on the screen, and so film-makers show off and show us a formation of Tamworths, which is something which will look impressive in the trailer.  To show us less is to make our minds fill in the gaps.  This way, we create our own terrors, perfectly fitted to ourselves.  The ghastly face I see in my head, is the ghastly head which I find scary.  The ghastly face I am shown may be one I can cope with quite easily.  If I see a believable character screaming in hysterical fear at something I cannot see, my own brain creates demons for my night\\'s dreams, demons far more mighty than anything CGI graphics or a latex mask could portray.This film will stay in your thoughts for some while. I saw this film last night, LONG after all the hype and reviews were made about it. I settled in with the right mood for any film: no expectations. If you expect too much, you may be let down (take note for any Kubrick film). I watched the entire film without interruption and came out with a great feeling. \"The Blair Witch Project\" is one darn good movie.Many critics and moviegoers complained about the film for its length, its amateurish photography/editing, and its lack of adequate acting. I feel these things MADE THE MOVIE. First, the film has to be at most ninety minutes long: any more, and it would be too long and boring. Second, the amateur video take gives the audience the feel that they are actually in the woods, listening to the rippling water of the creek, snapping branches under their boots, and hearing things go bump in the night. I greatly admire the use of two video cameras (one black-and-white, the other color) to denote which character is shooting the film. Lastly, the incessant screaming of whiny Heather, the constant complaining of average-joe Mike, and the Dudley-Do-Rightness of Josh make for great acting. Yes, these are regular people and up-and-coming actors from your local community theater, but YOU KNOW THEM. You\\'ve met people like them.The biggest complaint, however, comes from the film\\'s supposed \"lack\" of scary moments. This film reminds me of the classic horror film \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,\" and though not as gory and as shocking as that film, \"The Blair Witch Project\" shows just enough fright in the group\\'s search for a way out of the woods, stalked by people and/or things they may never understand. In the older film, the long interval between opening credits and first gory act of violence is about thirty minutes long; it is even longer here, but the suspense/fright (just as in the older film) begins right from the opening credits: you just don\\'t see it until the film\\'s over. These are three people out to make a documentary in the woods with handheld camcorders--these are REAL PEOPLE. And GREAT ACTORS. Heather whines a lot and screams and reminds you of the girl you hate so much you fall in love with her. Her screams sound real, her cries are genuine, and she is DEEPLY DEEPLY sorry for bringing the others into the woods in order to film her documentary.I really dig the beginning. It seems so real to me I may delve into my old home movies for nostalgia. Heather and Josh pick up Mike, then go to the store for supplies. This opening sequence really packs a punch. These are three Generation Xers out for a camping trip. We all know what happens to them, but we\\'re glued to the screen, intent to know what actually happens.The interviews give us some detail into the Blair Witch legend, but most of the audience is too busy thinking about the actual trek into the woods that they don\\'t listen. This is wrong. Listening is good. The interviews, which also sound real and not rehearsed in any way, are like movie reviews: the critics tell you what they saw, but mostly they don\\'t want to ruin it for you...unless they hated it.And that\\'s what I\\'ll do. I won\\'t ruin it for you. 8/10. I think I know why Blair Witch has generated as much negative as positive responses.  It FORCES YOU TO BECOME INVOLVED IN THE MOVIE GOING EXPERIENCE!Wow.  What a concept.  Instead of sitting there like the passive sponges most of us become when going to the movies we are actually expected be become involved.  Take a leap of faith/belief or whatever and delve into this movie.  Without the overpowering F/X and music score most movies rely on to \\'scare\\' you, if you still have an imagination left what is implied becomes a hundred times scarier than anything offered up by Hollywood in the last 30 years.  The hardest thing in movies is to scare you.  Not make you jump out of your seat with 5000 watts of sound blasting at 400 decibels (ever seen the 1999 version of the Haunting?  Event Horizon? - every potentially tense scene is preceeded by dead silence then the Blast).  Wake up people!  Blair Witch is the horror movies we have been needing for a long time and I\\'m glad someone finally had the guts to make it. Like most movies, whether or not someone likes TBWP will usually depend on what they\\'re looking for.  Many people enjoy horror movies because of the special effects, gore, shocks, and, in some cases, the high production value.  Since TBWP came from a small independent film company that cost less than a hundred grand to make, can a moviegoer really expect all that and have a good time?  I honestly don\\'t think so.Myrick and Sanchez had a terrific idea for a film: make a frightening mock documentary that was supposed to look like it was done by some amateur college students.  Some people seem to be under the impression that the movie was about the witch, when what it really was about the mental and emotional breakdown of the three film students.  I feel that once viewers could accept the low production values and the improvised script, only then could they deal with Heather, Josh, and Mike.  Until they do that, the film would never work for them.I just put myself in their position:  I\\'m lost in the woods, I\\'m tired, I\\'m hungry, and I\\'ve got the added stress of returning borrowed equipment.  The weather is getting colder, it rains just enough to make life miserable, and something is waking me up each and every night.  Now, I\\'m exhausted, grouchy, scared, and I having troubles thinking clearly.People might have hated Heather because they she was bitchy and annoying, but all three of them had their moments, good and bad. Many people might have also hated the fact that not everything was explained to them, and that they never got to see the Blair Witch.  Many other people may have resented Artisan Entertainment\\'s marketing campaign, although they can\\'t deny just how effective it was.  All the filmmakers and actors asked was that filmgoers understand the spirit that was intended; without it, they knew the film couldn\\'t work for anybody.As you might already tell, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  What Haxan Films managed to do with what they had is not only revolutionary, but is also inspirational to independent filmmakers everywhere.  I found the backstory interesting, the plotline well thought out, and the characters extremely developed, considering the lack of structure and guidelines within the film. If you do decide to see this film, I think you\\'ll enjoy it if you see it for what it simply is, nothing more; it might even scare the hell out of you! Privileged to see a preview of this fantastically terrifying film, I found myself actually feeling the pain and mind-numbing anguish of the characters. At times in the movie, I would find myself trying to peer through the darkness with them, fully realizing that there was absolutely no chance of knowing what was out there.  I think that is the most effective aspect of this, the fear of the unknown.  I really can\\'t think of anything more frightening than something that has no identity, and so you don\\'t know how to relate or react, and you are forced to suffer through the unknown.  A key component also included in this film was the steady decline of human spirit that you witness first-hand.  You watch as the characters are broken down to small, scared, hunted animals, and you find yourself shaking your head at how pitiful and helpless they have become, yet you don\\'t feel sorry for them, only agonizing hope that they will escape the fear with at least their lives.  Wonderfully created film that, at least for me, an outdoor enthusiast who used to enjoy wandering alone through familiar woods, will always haunt me to the core of my soul when I look around and see nothing but endless woods, unknown sounds, and things that are never seen. With all the hype surrounding this new independent horror film, you might think it would be hard for it to live up to expectations. The Blair Witch Project is probably as scary as it\\'s reputation. Feel free to read on, I do not intend to give away any of the film\\'s secrets or surprises. The less you know about this creepy little chiller, the better.Filmed on video and 16mm black &amp; white, this film is exactly what the horror genre needs in a time reminiscent of the early 1980s slasher onslaught. The Blair Witch Project has no knife wielding maniacs, no DNA altered monsters, and no real bloodshed onscreen. We see what the three film makers see as they make their way through the deep, dank woods in search of a legendary witch. There are times when there is nothing but a black screen, and all we can do is listen to their scared voices and the unexplained noises going on around them. The true horror behind this film is the unknown, and those dark places where you know something is lurking.If you are a seasoned veteran of the horror cinema, The Blair Witch Project may be less frightening than for someone who has not seen many scary movies. You will have to respect it\\'s originality, and it\\'s manipulation of our deepest fears. At times the film really makes you feel the sense of dread the film makers are experiencing. One thing I did notice about the audience in the theater is that everyone was very quiet. Except for an occasional gasp, the moviegoers were absorbed in this film. That\\'s unusual for a modern horror movie. Most are full of fake scare tactics and multiple twist endings that keep the audience shouting and screaming at the screen. One thing for sure, you can expect many imitations of The Blair Witch Project in the future. Isn\\'t that how it usually goes? Hmm. Wow. What is there left to say? I\\'ve waited for most of the hype to die down to even add my comments for this movie to IMDB, and here they are:This is really a movie that has polarized a lot of people. Many love it and consider it the best thing since sliced bread, and plenty more absolutely hate it and call it tripe, drivel, awful, wretched, the worst ever, etc. (NOTE: as far as I\\'m concerned, the opinions of anyone calling any movie the best- or even more especially, the worst- movie ever are to be immediately disregarded.) Highly innovative in its way, it spawned many parodies and an interesting but inferior sort-of sequel. In the summer of Star Wars: Episode 1, this was the movie that originated several cultural symbols.I saw this movie shortly after it opened in wide release. Sitting in a theater surrounded by my friends with popcorn in my lap and watching Mike and Heather run around some creepy old house, I felt for the first and last time in my adult life *real, creeping fear* when I myself was not in danger.Many have complained about the shaky-cam, the cussing, how nothing \\'really happens\\', and that it\\'s not scary. By and large, the camera is not *that* shaky, at least to the point where you can\\'t understand why- they\\'re tromping through the woods and they\\'re scared half to death. I must not get queasy very easily, as I had no problem with it. As for the cussing- the lines were ad-libbed, the actors are college-age, and all three sound exactly like every American college student I\\'ve ever known. So maybe people have a problem with young peoples\\' language, but what else is new? That\\'s not a flaw of the movie- it\\'s realism and part of why so many more young people found TBWP scary.I think at least some of the dissention in opinions is caused by generational and cultural differences. My mother\\'s friends told me it wasn\\'t scary, but that \\'Psycho\\' terrified them. \\'Psycho\\', while interesting and a classic, is not the least bit scary to me. \\'The Excorcist\\' has only a couple scenes that I find frightening, but my mom breaks out in goosebumps at the mere mention of it. The scariest thing I ever saw until I watched this movie was a reel in a collection of horror shorts: a woman walks into her house carrying groceries, drops her keys down her heating vent, bends down to try to get them, and something grabs her scarf. She struggles, but within a minute or two, she\\'s drug down and strangled. The scarf goes slack, the woman is lying dead on her floor, and that\\'s it.TBWP is about what you *can\\'t see*, about how your fear of the unknown is so much worse than what the unknown could probably ever be. The characters were not even necessarily likable, but they were *familiar*- Heather is the girl I sit next to in film class who thinks she has all the answers. Their mundane existence, captured in the beginning of the film, roots them in reality. What happens to them is terrifying because they are so every day, so interchangable with millions of other college kids. And, finally, you never know whether the Witch exists or not. Everything that happens can be explained away by coincidence, pranksters, bats, hunger, exhaustion and imaginations run wild with fear- or you can choose not to explain them away.Young Americans are not scared of much- school shootings can roll off us like water, the evil human beings inflict on each other is run-of-the-mill 6 o\\'clock news, we are raised in a culture that claims to worship a vengeful, elitist god while almost everyone is hypocritical and uses the power of spirituality as a way to abuse others. We are in information overload from birth. What we fear is not knowing. And in the Black Hills Woods of Maryland, just beyond the flashlight\\'s reach, something is making strange and terrible noises- but we don\\'t know what it is. I\\'ve never seen the tide turn on movie reviews before like I did in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. First, I heard this movie was the scariest movie since THE EXORCIST, then I heard it was the worst movie of the year. When people thought it might be real, they loved it. Then, when everyone found out it was fake, I heard all sorts of bad things about it.THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is about three young filmmakers, Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Josh Leonard (actors with same names as their characters), go out into the woods of Burkittesville, Maryland to do a documentary on the mythical Blair Witch. They are never found, but a year later their footage is discovered, and it seems to indicate that there really was a witch and it was stalking these three filmmakers.I did not find THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT especially scary, although it was rather spooky. I did think it was good, with an excellent and very original plot. The acting in this movie by the three young kids was very good, especially if the rumors about how they improvised most of it were true. The character development was well done, and you will often find yourself waiting for daylight along with the characters.Was this movie overhyped? A little, but I think if it wasn\\'t that it wouldn\\'t have been as successful, since the actors, writers and directors are relatively unknown. They did a very good job and I hope to see more works from them in the near future.Sure, some of the realism could\\'ve been better. Even I knew that they should\\'ve followed the stream out of the woods instead of going deeper into the forest. And if this was happening to me, I doubt I\\'d pick up the video camera and tape it all instead of running like hell. But it still worked. I think the scariest part is how you don\\'t see as much as you hear, because often the sound is 10 times worse than the thing making the sound.This movie isn\\'t too scary, but if you watch it in the middle of the night with all your lights off and alone, it will successfully freak you out. It\\'s worth a rent or a buy, judge for yourself. This movie scared me in a way that no other has done before.  I remember going to camp as a child, and hearing things outside at night.  That was scary enough.  This movie recreated that entire scenario and then added some to it.  The fact that those things that go bump in the night outside your campsite were REAL in this movie makes it more nerve-inducing and frightening.  As anyone, the first time I set foot in the ocean after seeing JAWS for the first time, I was nervous.  Let me tell you in order to get from the movie theater to my house, I have to drive through the woods. After seeing this movie, that drive got SIGNIFICANTLY longer, more eerie, and scared the heck out of me.  I went about 90 mph all the way home in order to get out of the woods!  This is one SCARY movie. I spent about an hour and a half sitting around in my living room on halloween waiting for something...anything to happen.  Just when I thought it was coming to the big climax at the end in the house, nothing happens....big surprise.This movie is a complete waste of time..there is nothing scary about it unless you find filming shots of the woods, watching swearing teens, listening to a high pitched annoying girl voice (that was pretty scary), watching film from inside a tent with cheap sound effects playing outside, or watching a wobbly camera run through the woods at night (cant see anything), then you should skip this movie.  If I was out in the middle of the woods, I too would decide to throw away my only way of finding my way around..my map. This movie had a weak, if any plot.  This movie was one of the biggest let downs I have ever seen, and I\\'ve seen \"Batman and Robin.\"I\\'ve never seen BWP 2, but it\\'s anything like this movie, it will be equally bad if not worse, because I would have to waste another 90 minutes of my life. I\\'ve seen worse movies, but not many.  Yes, I like horror films.  Yes, I can distinguish cheap, sensationalistic splatter-horror from from the more chilling, show-less-and-frighten-more variety (and I prefer the latter to the former).I still hated Blair Witch.  I don\\'t lack imagination, but this movie certainly did.  I\\'ve seen Tampax commercials that filled me with greater fear.  The film lacked wit, style, story, plot, suspense, or verve.  I don\\'t need expensive cinematography or stellar acting, but a film does need something to redeem itself (other than a sophomoric, if marginally clever, idea), and this film did not have it.It is unfortunate that a bad movie has come to represent to many the epitome of independent cinema.  For a real horror masterpiece, see Ringu (The Ring), which, though it was probably filmed on a larger budget, worked because of talented direction and great storyline. Is there?  Because if there is, I want to see it.  I went to see this movie because all my friends told me that it would scare me.  I\\'ve never been even remotely frightened by a movie before.  This movie didn\\'t even come close to scaring me.  It was so unbelievably asinine and stupid that I can\\'t believe it even got picked up for distribution, much less called \"great\".  I can\\'t believe it made the amount of money it did.  I should have demanded a refund.  Let\\'s put it this way -- if I took a few of my friends into the woods, with a video camera, and made scary noises at them so that they could pretend to scream, it would undoubtedly be scarier and superior to this movie.  I\\'m sorry, but those \"blair witch\" noises sounded exactly like someone playing a prank on them.  A waste of my $7. This is the worst waste of film I have ever witnessed in my life. I cannot fathom what people who loved this movie are thinking. WOW! The \"actors\" seem to be talking off the cuff, the script- if there was one, lacked any imagination or anything clever to say.  Movies that have parodied this crappy movie do a better job of conveying fear. I understand the premise, of course. Make the movie appear like a home movie where some young people encounter some weird and horrific experiences. The problem is, most vacation home movies are more compelling and clever. Whenever there was a hint of tension, the actor would swear or scream, for lack of anything better they could think of. This film experience was memorable to me and those who watched it with me, for one reason. It is easily the worst I have ever seen. It makes \"Freddie Got Fingered\" look like \"Gone With The Wind\"- which is where \"Blair Witch project\" should go. If you are looking for something to scare you, look somewhere else, this is the worst excuse I have seen for a horror film. The style of shooting was as expected, shaky hand held camera, which fitted the premise of the film, but you felt like you were watching an amateur film by school kids rather than actual footage of a real event which it was supposed to depict.Normally I expect a horror to get my heart racing a few times, and have some surprises, but the plot was too obvious, there were no surprises, nothing that would make you jump.I would not recommend this to any film buff, ignore the hype and skip this film. well i hated this movie the first time. so one year lated i rented it again to see \"what was i missing???\"well i am missing a brain for thinking that it might improve with age or a second time aroundit doesn\\'t ==== as a matter of fact it gets worse.i don\\'t get the big deal -=------ it is NOT scary, NOT entertaining, does NOT hold your interest, it does NOT have good characters, it does NOT make you think.  it isn\\'t even mindless fun.it is just stupid and annoying and a complete waste of time.  i guess one can never underestimate the taste of the public at large.  this movie deserved to make $0.i still think the entire budget of the movie went to beer and pizza.  and twigs and rocks.made me save money by NOT going to see Blair Witch 2. A film which fell foul of its own publicity machine, `The Blair Witch Project\\' was abhorred and derided by the mainstream film-going public which it became unfortunately directed at due to its extraordinary and outlandish marketing campaign. `The Blair Witch Project\\' is not a typical film that the typical cinema-going public would normally be exposed to. The camera-work is jerky, the dialogue repetitive and inane and the action virtually non-existent. At times confusing, annoying, irritating and tedious, this film is nonetheless a brilliant piece of arthouse experimental film-making. This movie is virtually all style-there\\'s hardly any plot, no real action, no semblance of a real script-and one that works on a deeper psychological level than the standard mainstream horror film. Indeed, only the very last image in the film is truly frightening, and only if it can be correlated to an incident at the very beginning. The rest of it only becomes scary afterwards, when the audience has had time to consider what they\\'ve seen. It is groundbreaking, manipulative cinema made without a script, with an amateur cast and with little or no post-production values. This is a remarkable film which can only really be appreciated, if the accompanying hype is overlooked, as a unique, avant-garde art film and not the regular Hollywood stock it was presented as to the public. I\\'d confidently say that this film has got to be one of the biggest movie-swindles ever perpetrated on a completely unsuspecting audience.With a devilishly clever publicity campaign to fuel its release, The Blair Witch Project (TBWP, for short) became the 2nd most successful \"indie\" film of all time, grossing nearly $250 million. Its success was surpassed in 2002 by My Big Fat Greek Wedding.Directed by Eduardo Sanchez, TBWP is presented as a documentary pieced together from amateur footage and filmed in real time. TBWP was shot in a matter of just 8 days and all of the dialogue was, pretty much, improvised.TBWP tells the tale of 3 young Film Students who hike out into the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland to film a documentary about a local legend known as The Blair Witch.The viewer is told that these 3 students were never found, although their video and sound equipment (along with the footage they shot) was discovered a year later.In my opinion, TBWP completely fails to deliver on all counts.*Trivia Note* - Throughout the course of the story the word \"Fukk\" was spoken 154 times. With this film having a running time of 87 minutes, that averages out to about one \"Fukk\" every 45 seconds. If you thought that \"Star Wars Episode 1\" was the most over-hyped letdown of the year, get ready.  \"The Blair Witch Project\" is so shockingly bad it could have been made by your ninth grade brother\\'s friends on their first camping trip this summer.  Shot primarily with a poor quality video (which appears to pre-date steadyshot), \"Blair Witch\" should have had a hard time getting into student film and video festivals based on the poor visual and sound quality alone.  Instead, it has won prizes and accolades at both Cannes and Sundance, and has become the new indie darling of film critics most everywhere. But, \"Blair Witch\" is far scarier than many of the critics have even begun to hint at.  It\\'s basically 80 minutes of watching amateurs stuck in flat woods, running in circles, with no concept of shot composition, no script, no performance talent, and absolutely no idea of what the hell they are doing.  This is the movie that puts the \\'horror\\' in horrible.\"Blair Witch\" is supposed to be about the making of a documentary.  Is this supposed to represent a documentary film crew? A girl who is a complete bitch, and two dweebs who act like whiny versions of Beavis and Butt-head. The interminable fits of yelling and screaming will have you bored stiff. Do stick figures made of wood, and the sounds of nearby \"filmmakers\" making funny noises in the woods give you the creeps?...if so, you might actually find this frightening.Well, as audiences everywhere are finding out (as Cinemascore is indicating), \"The Blair Witch Project\" is not a good film, and certainly not what they were told it would be.  Shame on critics making comparisons to horror classics like \"The Exorcist\" and \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\". Those were bold masterpieces of terror in which the scripts were solid before production began.  Jeez, even \"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\" was scarier than \"Blair Witch\" (if Jennifer Love\\'s breasts get any bigger...) Any dolt can do what the makers of \"Blair Witch\" have done, just look at the worst home videos your neighbor Larry has in his collection (but Larry knows how to use that tripod his wife bought him last Xmas).To quote Bart Simpson from that great Halloween episode with Poe\\'s \"The Raven\"; \"Do you know what would have been scarier than nothing?.....................ANYTHING!!\" CONTAINS SPOILERS In Berkeley, The Blair Witch Project generated a lot of a certain type of buzz that will often make me wary and I avoided seeing it during its first run, suspecting that I\\'d feel the rip of an eight-dollar ticket. After having screened a VHS copy acquired at Yard Sale Videos, I still feel that way a little but not because I didn\\'t like it. Seeing it in a theater would have precluded being able to really watch a film like this the way I prefer to do.I had to stretch a bit to get past some aspects of the film\\'s setup. The self-filmed documentary approach can\\'t quite carry the movie\\'s weight through its entire length. Some sequences could not have been filmed by any of the protagonists, as was the implication, yet there they were. No one among the three `film makers\\' could have managed the presence of mind, in the midst deep panic, to have filmed Heather running screaming through the dark woods. It was all too far out of pre-established character, although the image is certainly indelible. But even a Dodge Dart with a brown door will get you there if it keeps running and once past my initial hesitations, I was forced to admit that The Blair Witch Project is.very effective.There are moments when Blair Witch has the dankness of Silence of The Lambs and the raw, twilit scariness of the opening few minutes of Night of the Living Dead, in my opinion one of the great horror sequences. I became a true believer at the point where Josh and Mike began to realize that something was very wrong in the crackling Burkittsville woods, that they really had to get out, and were ramping up to full freak while Heather simply refused to stop filming although there was really nothing to film. This sequence nailed perfectly the deep frustration one can feel under the sway of a relentless know-it-all, especially when said person is female and, thereby, largely immune to the more primordial forms of conversation reserved for males. Josh and Mike, aggravated and frightened as they were, still could not abandon Heather, who had become more of a liability at that point than an asset. Both had begun to succumb to the stress of walking the razor edge between being scared squat-less and being unable to admit it.The Blair Witch Project has an unassuming, almost sneaky way of getting to you. First off, the main characters are not at all likeable, which in itself is fatiguing. Josh and Mike are types that might be found at loose ends on any Saturday night, marooned in a mall or mini-mart parking lot. Heather is an almost-cute, soon-to-be-overweight, classic candidate for domestic violence at the hands of a future husband or boyfriend equipped with no sense of humor, or of the ironic. A few minutes with them and you are more than ready to burn out from slogging the monotonous autumn woods where night, freed from the shackles of Daylight Savings Time, comes too soon and remains too long. When the exhausted trio takes to its sleeping bags, you\\'re right with them. Then, you\\'re suddenly wide awake for all the wrong reasons. The sound of fracturing wood, out past a wall of darkness on which strong flashlight beams pile up like pizza dough, are not just twigs being snapped. They\\'re branches, big ones. But this conclusion is never verbalized by any of the trio. One of the three refers to the sound as `footsteps\\' but only if the feet are size-72 American. It\\'s left up to us to fully grasp the implications.The three principal actors are, essentially, playing themselves and all perfectly manifest the giddy hubris reserved for those who may be able to come fifteen times a day but possess just enough knowledge and experience to be dangerous. But playing one\\'s self may be harder than it looks and they do so with conviction, most notably the tough-minded, endlessly irritating Heather. Her character may be packing the only real cojones in the bunch and when she finally begins to unglue near the end, you know the doo-doo has gotten very deep. It\\'s not mere post-adolescent, cheeseburger-craving discomfort any longer. That trifle has been left far behind; somewhere back under the decaying leaves. Heather\\'s runny-nosed, video self-portrait, made upon realizing that she and her companions are in far, far over their heads, is truly poignant. We may enjoy seeing vain, clueless teens get theirs in slasher movies but the Blair Witch trio; three somewhat loosely-wrapped goofballs trying to pull off a film-making project, are really not clueless in the classic sense nor are they stupid. They\\'ve just intrepidly placed themselves in a very wrong place for which there may be no possible right time.And finally the ending, which is really what this film is all about. Almost everything you ever feared in your youth, both in the light of day and dark of night, is compressed perfectly into the film\\'s last few seconds. When the evil suggested throughout finally thunders down like stagnant water through a breached dam, the result is possibly the most viscerally disturbing horror sequence ever produced. All exploding skulls, bursting rib cages, and dangling intestines ever filmed are mere confetti alongside its simple, implicit power. Only the discovery of the maternal corpse in the basement, in Psycho, even comes close. Keep the little ones away from this one, Mom and Dad. A child\\'s mind will have no defense, nowhere to run, and most disturbing, nothing tangible to run from; only an invisible, meticulously goal-oriented malevolence that comes from nowhere, and everywhere, at once. Some observations:Anyone who thinks this movie is scary has lived a sheltered life, indeed.Those who gave this dreck anything higher than a \"5\" probably bought pet rocks when they were on the market.This flick will go down in history as another \"Billy Jack.\" (Remember it was getting high ratings for the first few years.)As far as one of the producers saying he noticed people vomiting after having seen the movie, they were probably made physically ill at having thought of being ripped off like they had been.This flick sucks beyond words.... This one is like the fable about the Emperor and his new clothes. He didn\\'t have any, and the Blair Witch doesn\\'t have any. This thing was awful, I wanted to like it, I expected to like it, I tried to like it, I came away hating it. I saw this thing three times, and while it\\'s got a great idea, and it\\'s not terrible for a student film say, it\\'s far far too long and boring for the one trick it\\'s got to pull, I simply am at a loss as to how so many people can allegedly have loved this thing. As anyone who has read my reviews for any length of time knows, I don\\'t kiss ass when it comes to independent films. If it\\'s a good film; I rate it accordingly, if it\\'s a bad film; I do likewise. However....It\\'s become one of my pet peeves that indie film fans demand that EVERY independent film be called nothing short of a masterpiece no matter how mundane it is, no compromise. It\\'s this mentality that has resulted in my extreme dislike of indie films and their fans and filmmakers. Honestly; just because something was made without studio assistance and/or interference DOES NOT automatically make it a masterpiece, any more than having the hot new centerfold of-the-month makes the next Michael Bay film an Oscar contender. Yet, still the indie zombies insist that it does, supposedly this mentality comes from resenting Hollywood\\'s excesses, such as taking away artistic control, bloated budgets, inattention to casting appropriate actors in favor of popular ones, and worst of all; annoying marketing campaigns. What BS.Indie films are guilty of many hypocrisies; but attacking marketing campaigns is their biggest; as endless marketing hype(along with pure stupidity)is the only reason anyone would have seen this clunker I\\'m currently reviewing.I can recall, quite vividly; the endless pop-up ads, the fan sites; official and(supposedly)unofficial, magazine articles, TV. specials, the merchandise, the relentless TV. commercials. Whew. The people who complain about the \\'Dark Knight\\'s marketing campaign just plain weren\\'t ALIVE to not know the extent of this films marketing(which makes sense; since 99.9% of all the negative TDK reviews I\\'ve seen couldn\\'t have been written by someone older than 5 or 8). TDK had NOTHING on this film\\'s relentless marketing campaign.Trashing Hollywood for over hyping their products, then doing the same: that\\'s the definition of hypocrisy. That alone would be justification enough to dislike TBWP and it\\'s indie film moron cult and to call them hypocritical and give the film a 1 rating, even if it was a good movie, even if I had liked it.The fact that it also sucked as a film anyway just justifies my rating.The common defense is that this is some brilliant \\'art-film\\' which introduced the concept of not showing the monster and leaving it to the imagination. BS. Val Lewton did the same thing a thousand times better during the \\'40\\'s, with films which are classics of the genre: \\'Cat People\\', \\'The Seventh Victim\\'. etc. and in 1963; probably the best of all \\'unseen\\' horror films; Robert Wise(a disciple of Lewton)\\'s \\'The Haunting\\' was released; to borrow an indie film fan phrase: it PWNED \\'Blair Witch\\'. All classics, all achieving their suspense without showing the monster. All before this film.But indie fans ignore all this; they claim those movies don\\'t count because they are old and in black &amp; white. Typical response from them, no respect for older film.As for the \\'story\\' of this film and it\\'s qualities; I wouldn\\'t even give it a D if it was a student film. The device of not showing the monster comes off less as an artistic choice and more an excuse to film nothing but a couple of dumb-asses running around and passing it off as a film. I\\'ll admit it\\'s clever, heck, even Lewton originally adopted the device out of necessity, but he did it mostly because he recognized it\\'s dramatic potential in the face of several alternatives. For the record, it is also a complete and utter rip-off of a much better film called \\'The Last Broadcast\\', the difference being that there is a survivor. Really, otherwise it\\'s the same damn thing, and it\\'s the indie film fans who call Hollywood unoriginal(If only I could use the eye-roll emoticon).The story also sucks, \\'Cannibal Holocaust\\' did the \\'found footage\\' thing much better. The \\'acting\\' is also awful; it\\'s so forced you wonder if the witch is a legitimate legend even in the context of the story. The praise for characterization is true, though. I definitely felt something about the characters: I wanted all 3 of them dead within a minute. And even if, pray tell, the device of not showing the monster WAS original, or had been used well; does it REALLY matter if it\\'s an awful film otherwise? Nope. At best, it just revives a long-dead gimmick.And for all the people who say it must be good because so many people thought it was real, let me ask you something: Have you ever heard the phrase \\'Idiots will believe anything\\'? Grow up and watch some atmospheric, \\'unseen\\' horror films that are actually good. This is no different than your usual incredibly stupid, vapid Hollywood slasher flick with annoying teenage victims, only without a slasher and not made by Hollywood, but still incredibly stupid , vapid and filled with annoying teenage victims.~ *** This comment contains spoilers *** As a fan of movies and horror films for 45 years, I\\'ve seen a lot, and I have to say that BWP is a totally amateurish piece of junk.To call this a \"film\" is laughable. It has no plot, no ending, no story. It is the 90 minute rambling of some dunderhead carrying around a hand held camera filming everything he sees. This movie was made by loading some film, getting some nobodies together, going to the woods and shooting enough film to make up 90 minutes. No film was left on the cutting room floor. Every worthless scrap was included. The ineptitude and total lack of film-making skills is astounding. I used to think Robot Monster was the pits; BWP is worse.Here is what happens in the \"film\". Three dimwits find a tape made by three nitwits who supposedly uncovered the Blair witch and were never seen again. The three dimwits head into the forest to investigate. Along the way they hear weird noises at night, find some sticks hanging from trees, get lost in the forest, start to cry because they are so scared. In the end one of the dimwits wanders into an abandoned shack and the last scene shows him trying to look scared into the camera. THE END. That\\'s all folks. I\\'m not kidding. That\\'s the movie.In these times when anyone has access to equipment to make a movie, BWP proves the theory that any talent less person can make a \"film.\" BWP was the biggest movie marketing SCAM in history. It proves P.T. Barnum\\'s \"There\\'s a sucker born every minute.\" By using the internet to lie and hype the film, the cynical lug heads who made this suckered people in. As they say in the used car business, \"For every seat, there\\'s an ass.\" I was one of the asses who got suckered. Using the same \"based on a true story\" technique as The Amityville Horror, BWP lured well-intentioned moviegoers into the theater. If BWP were a car then it would be subject to a \"lemon law\" and you could get your money back. Unfortunately, the movie business doesn\\'t work that way. Those of us who lost our $$ on this scam have no recourse. The only recourse I have is to slam this piece of trash in this review, which I hope I have done. Why I detest BWP so much is because it was such a shameless scam that showed utter contempt for movie goers. This was not a film; it was just a mechanism to cheat people out of their money.I would rather watch Robot Monster ten times than ever see BWP again. After seeing the Bland Witch Project, now I can understand why so many people ran from the cinemas screaming...they wasted $10 for nothing! This fictional documentary within a pseudo-documentary form may be the most overrated, under-financed piece of film to come down the pike in a long time. Where is the suspense? Where is the involvement? Where is the identification? The spectacle of three film-student types traipsing off cluelessly into an unfamiliar forest with a reported history of gruesome violence is just plain stupid. We know from a printed foreword that the three young film-makers are doomed, and by the time I got to know them a little I didn\\'t much care what happened to them. Is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT a masterful ghost film or a gimmick to create a multi-media event?  It is both.  The picture, shot on super 8 video and 16mm film displayed in a squared, documentary-like frame, is quirky, annoying, and spectacularly scary.  The scenes at night quite frankly scared the hell out of me.  The gimmick that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is created confusion and wonder over whether or not the footage shot was real life.  Now, we all know the truth, but the French term \\'cinema verite\\' is defined by this grisly film.A guaranteed cult classic, BLAIR WITCH has \"Heather, Mike, and Josh\" heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of Maryland looking for the Blair Witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills.  For most of the film, it is very unclear.  The beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are a) experiencing the supernatural, b) being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople or c) just completely out of their minds.  Its up to the viewer to decide but my money is on option A.Most filmgoers know that the filmmakers Sanchez and Myrick used their MAC cards and cookie jars to put this phenom together and I commend them.  This is a tour-de-force thriller that does indeed seem real.  Its all improvised and \\'verite\\' like and the best part about the movie\\'s many chills are based on the basic premise that scares most of us:  We are generally frightened by what we cannot see.  Many times throughout the film, the screen is completely dark with sudden bursts of screams and grainy scenery.  For the sake of the suspense, the film may have been better if we did not know the gimmick.  The realism is sometimes smothering.True, the hand-held camera can make you achy in the head, but the way the actors play off each other is magic and not for the faint of heart.  I viewed the film on DVD with someone who was not feeling too well because of the dizzying camera, but somehow the black and white and color and rain blend together and allow Myrick and Sanchez to do what they were attempting to do.  Spooking an audience with unseen forces is so effective and I was reminded of Robert Wise\\'s original THE HAUNTING from 1963 with the groans and the cries and the shrieks.  A baby\\'s giggle can be heard during one spellbinding scene when the tent the 3 students sleep in takes on a life of its own.Much has been made about a similar film made in similar fashion by some other young auteurs well before THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was released.  I never saw it and if it was as good as this film we would\\'ve seen it. Nonetheless, this past summer shocked and surprised me with the amount of good horror pictures around.  In the woods, no one can hear you scream either.Rating: ***1/2',\n",
       " \"Practically the definitive underground classic.  Shot primarily in a seedy bathroom, it's gross, outrageously blasphemous, trippy, campy and hilarious, esp. if seen very, very high.  Sometime Village Fug Tuli Kupferberg plays a vulgar NY Jewish G*d who never gets out of the tub.  The story line is the debate in an ecumenical trailer trash Heaven during Abraham's biblical trial of faith over the sacrifice of his son Isaac.You get obscene, low-life commentary on Kierkegaardian existentialism and stoned critiques of the world's major faiths served up with plenty of Triune trash-talk.  But you're more interested in the wide-eyed houris who service the Almighty or the signifying Holy Ghost - a plasticine blackface lackey who regularly pops out of the toilet to dis up the ineffectual ineffable One.My favorite character is the Buddha, who shows up at precisely the wrong moment to change the course of history.Don't know where you'll find a screening of this howler.  Have heard nothing about it for 25+ years.  Rumor had it that Director Michael Hirsch had the only remaining print of it.\",\n",
       " 'While I give this one star, I strongly encourage everyone to see this movie. Not because it is good or has a single redeeming factor, but because if Ed Wood set out intentionally with an unlimited budget to make the worst movie ever, he could not have made something this bad.The law of large numbers would seem to imply that in 86 minutes you\\'d have to get something right by accident, and yet this movie doesn\\'t. A second look at Alien Apocalypse (which admittedly requires a masochistic nature to undertake) at least reveals passable cinematography and consistent lighting. And yet Sharknado rises above mathematics to give us a film that is bad in every single possible way.Continuity is shrugged off completely. The same scene moves from daylight to dusk, rain to sunshine, storm surge to quiet beach, with every single new camera angle. It is so blatantly bad you are distracted from the more subtle inconsistencies like objects moving around, attire, wind, or quality of film from one cut to the next.If you manage to close your eyes you are immediately taken in by the sound. How the sound editor managed to get to work on what had to be an acid-enhanced bender of epic proportions to warrant these results is beyond me. I\\'m reluctant to suggest using your stereo\\'s sound-leveling technology for fear your sound system will simply melt from the strain.One is almost loath to point a finger at suspension of disbelief when it comes to a movie whose premise is sharks in tornadoes, but whatever level you plan to come in with is almost surely going to fall far short. This movie has more WTF moments in 86 minutes than Lost could pull off in 86 seasons. And everyone gets to play, not just those with a working knowledge of wind shear or the physics that keep a helicopter in the air. If you\\'ve played pool, fished, surfed, driven a car in water deeper than two inches, been exposed to gravity, or otherwise in any way have interacted with or gained some understanding of the world around you, this movie has something for you to go \"wha!?!\" about.And while you would think that once you had bad special effects, bad editing, and bad sound strung together you\\'d get at least one Bruce Campbell out of the cast to latch on to. Not so here, as every actor turned in a performance that shows they were more confused than the viewer about what was happening. We could guess it was because they were given the script out of order, but as a viewer of the final product I\\'m not sure I\\'ve seen the scenes in order, they are that disjointed.I\\'ve tried very hard to find something that was done well or noteworthy about this movie and the only thing I can come up with is that it is the only movie I have ever seen that has failed on absolutely every level. If you tried to make a movie this bad you would inadvertently get something right purely on accident. And that is its one bright, shining point of light. That it would be almost impossible to make something this terrible ever again. For anyone who hasn\\'t seen the SyFy original movie, Sharknado; it\\'s a heart-warming, coming of age story about a ragtag group of sharks uprooted from their home by mother nature\\'s fury. The sharks must band together and overcome adversity and strife while trying, desperately, to make their way back to the only home they\\'ve ever known. Battling chainsaw wielding humans and B-list actors trying, desperately, to throw themselves into the displaced sharks\\' mouths every chance they get. If you love sharks and tornadoes, well...now you don\\'t have to choose! Do yourself a favor and see this one before the Oscars! Sharknado is, truly, the cinematic experience of a lifetime. And yet with a group of pals you would be hard pressed to find a better time. Absolutely nothing make sense. Physics and natural laws are ignored. Horrible CGI and cringe-worthy dialog. Outrageous continuity exceeded only by horrible color correction and clunky editing. The all together wooden acting no doubt achieved in single takes is sincere, earnest and fails on levels that should win awards. And you can\\'t stop watching. My friends, yelled, laughed, joked, stomped, laughed some more and had a fine time. Now how many times can you say that watching a movie? It literally becomes an interactive experience. It is surely a classic. Not sure exactly what kind. But it is a classic. It started out as some drug dealing people or something, I wasn\\'t really paying attention, and the Asian guy was like pew pew, and the other guy was like pew pew, and the sharks were like nm nm, and the crewmen were like AAAAAAAAAAAH! Then the sharks came on land and were like om nm nm!! And they were eating everyone and this reporter got eaten by a flying shark and then BAM! SHARK TORNADO! Oh yea, a bartender lady killed a shark with a cue stick somehow. And the sharks were flying and eating stuff and this guy got eaten but chainsawed his way out and VRRRRRM! He found some lady in there and they dropped bombs in the tornado cause yo lo and stuff. The shotgunned flying sharks, it was the best movie. Ever. I recommend it to everyone ever. People seem to think that this is the be all end all of bad movies when in actuality the movie was made this way on purpose. The thing that separates a good bad movie from a bad bad movie is intent. Take The Room for example. When Tommy Wiseau was making that movie, he had the best intentions and really thought that it was going to be a great movie. This is what makes it so satisfying to watch this movie. Wiseau put a lot of time and effort into it and it was utter crap. Sharknado was made to be dumbed down to reach their target audience and make them feel smarter than the movie. You can\\'t point and laugh at the director because this is what he wanted all along. What makes a film \"So bad it\\'s good\" is sincerity. Movies like Machete or Sharknado or the latest Asylum Mockbuster are either intentionally shitty or crass cash-grabs. Great terrible movies like the Room, Miami Connection, and Birdemic are completely sincere and honest in there awfulness, and that\\'s what makes them special. Sharknado is just ruining the experience of bad movies for people. All in all, if you truly are interested in bad movies, I recommend you watch something like Troll 2 or Miami Connection. Then again, what do I know? I\\'m just some asshole on the internet. With a title like Sharknado, you expect weird. This movie delivers.Grab some friends, lots of snacks, and a mammoth amount of suspension of disbelief. You\\'re now ready for SyFy channel\\'s latest escapade into the realm of the psychotically silly. This movie acts upon the mind like a mind altering substance, taking it to a land of shark-infested water spouts, science gone mad, absurd visuals, and movie making run amok. Riffing is optional; the movie is goofy and deranged either way.A freak-storm turns into tornadoes/water spouts that vacuum up a zillion sharks that are swimming around and whisks them off to southern California. Some of the finny predators are pitched into local freeways and everywhere else, while other sharks continue to spin around in the hurricane. The sharks take no prisoners as they swim around soggy streets and wreak havoc with laughable CGI attacks. I did notice however that they obeyed all traffic laws while they swam through the streets. This movie swims its way ever further into the realms of the jawbone dropping bizarre, with several key scenes to be on the lookout for. Look for the random one-in-a-million rescue near the end, and the wacky idea the heroes use to try and save the day. This sort of chaos is common throughout the entire movie.Kudos to the movie makers for this pure unabashed nonsense. This movie right here is a true wonder to the abilities of man kind. I recommend it to everyone. Truly the most entertaining movie I\\'ve seen in a very long time. I won\\'t spoil it for you, but I will share some interesting facts that I have learned from this film with you: 1. If it is raining very hard and floods are occurring, the inside of your house will flood first.2. If there is 2 feet of water, a 12 foot shark can not only swim with grace and elegance in it, the sheer speed it can reach before it leaps high and fast out of the water only to dive into that same two feet of water and disappear completely is truly astonishing. 3. If there is an EF5 tornado bearing down on Hollywood, not only do people continue about their daily lives as if the news isn\\'t telling them (which they are) that a hurricane is indeed wreaking terrible destruction about the town and to evacuate, it can also be sunny out with perfectly blue skies. Then suddenly dark and overcast again. Then suddenly sunny again. Then sudden..... well, i think you get my point.4. So if you really don\\'t want to bother with the tornado that has been produced by this mega hurricane that everyone just totally ignored until it was literally right on top of them, just assemble a makeshift bomb out of an R sized oxygen tank (about 14\" tall mind you), hop in a helicopter, fly over to that pesky twister, and blow it out of the sky with this amazingly powerful bomb. 5. You don\\'t have to be an actor/actress to be in a movie.So, in other words, do not miss this true gem. A modern masterpiece that will surely be winning some Oscars. Let me just say that I watched this movie to be entertained—not enthralled or hanging on the edge of my seat but just distracted and carefree for a couple of hours. I got what I wanted. Only, I didn\\'t expect to laugh so much. I\\'m thankful for the laughter, though, because it kept at bay any sort of aesthetic sense that might have interfered with my viewing pleasure.Regardless of genre, most movies are a construction of thoughtfully planned scenes, each of which presenting plot points and character motivations that, together, form a plausible narrative, allowing for the proverbial \"suspension of disbelief.\" Such careful craftsmanship is never more important than at a film\\'s beginning. The creators of Sharknado didn\\'t bother with any of that. There is an opening sequence involving a fishing boat on a stormy sea. On board a greedy captain in a raincoat and an Asian man in a three- piece suit squabble about money (presumably for some nefarious service performed by the captain). Handguns are soon brandished, bullets are fired, and chomping sharks are washed on deck by the waves (à la The Perfect Storm). People are shot or eaten, and a massive water spout filled with digitally-rendered sharks stretches into the sky. Then the opening credits begin rolling, and it\\'s as if that scene never happened. Other than the brief preview of the \"sharknado\" to come at the end of the second act (yes, I\\'m taking some liberties by using standard film vernacular to describe this storyline), it was as if this scene was jumbled together from leftover footage of some other SyFy shark movie. Did this bother me? Nope. In fact, it wasn\\'t until after the movie\\'s end that I even remembered the ship\\'s captain and the shootout on the water. By then, I was still grinning too much to care. One grin-evoking moment occurs when Nova, the leading female character played by Cassie Scerbo, stabs a shark to death with a cue stick in a bar. While this isn\\'t the first shark encounter for the protagonists or even the first shark-on-land encounter, it does seem to set the tone for the rest of the movie. Anthony Ferrante, the director, wants everyone to realize that this is not—and does not aspire to be—Jaws. Though he need not worry about anyone mistaking this shark movie for Steven Spielberg\\'s classic, Ferrante repeatedly makes references to it. I won\\'t use terms such as \"allusion\" or even \"homage\" to describe these references. Perhaps \"farcical\" might be more appropriate, or maybe \"comic relief,\" but even those terms lend themselves to a more contemplative critique than I am attempting. I think Ferrante\\'s purpose was to preemptively counter all would-be critics who might say things like \"This is no Jaws.\" He could have just titled the movie Another Killer Shark Film That Is Not Jaws. But that would have been too self-effacing and certainly not as much fun.In carrying out this strategy, Ferrante doesn\\'t waste much time. Moments after the sharks begin plopping onto the streets and docks, Fin—a bar-owner, father and former pro-surfer played by Ian Ziering of Beverly Hills, 90210 fame—makes quick work of one by shooting a diver\\'s air tank that is jutting out of its gullet, causing it and the shark to explode. Remind you of anything? Yep, there\\'s even a corny one-liner: \"That\\'s what you get for trying to eat me.\" Later we have a quasi-touching expository scene that reveals Nova\\'s pre-established hatred of sharks. The character of Fin\\'s son, Matt, played by Chuck Hittinger, notices an unusual scar on Nova\\'s thigh. To get her to talk about it, he lifts up his shirt and reveals a scar on his abdomen and explains its not-so-dramatic origin. When he asks Nova how she got her scar, she says she had a tattoo removed. Not buying it, Matt prods further and Nova tells a story about going fishing with her grandfather and his friends when she was a little girl. She says that their boat sank and sharks began to circle and attack them. The men managed to lift her out of the water and onto something floating nearby, but a shark still managed to take a hunk out of her leg. In summation, Nova says: \"Six people went into the water and one little girl came out. The sharks took the rest.\" The scene in Jaws in which Robert Shaw\\'s character Quint tells the tale of the sinking of the USS Indionapolis is arguably one of the most memorable scenes in film history. Ferrante knows this. Nova\\'s scar story, in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way, serves to again make the director\\'s statement: \"I am aware of Jaws, as is everyone in the civilized world, and this is not that movie!\"Later, this same point is made again, this time even more comically and pointedly. After fabricating some propane bombs, Nova and Matt take to the skies in a helicopter to hunt the tornadoes. Matt flies perilously close to one of the funnel clouds so that Nova can toss one of the bombs into it. She sees an enormous shark coming straight at them and declares: \"We\\'re gonna need a bigger chopper.\"If you want to be moderately entertained, then I don\\'t think you will be disappointed with Sharknado. Don\\'t expect too much going into it—and bring with you a willingness to suspend your own sense of disbelief. Most important, keep in mind that this is not Jaws. I don\\'t think that fact will slip you mind, however. The director made sure of it. 21 minutes into the movie and already a Jaws reference. My friend suggested The Avengers, or the Dark Knight. I said no, we\\'re watching Sharknado. The best decision I\\'ve ever made in my life. The acting done by Tara Reid is amazing I feel like I was actually living her shark filled life story. The amazing CGI gave me nightmares, filled with sharks, tornadoes, and former adult film actresses. The movie was directed by Michael Bay\\'s protégé, the lens flairs were amazing and blinded me with beauty. I truly feel that if someone ever breaks into my home, I will not grab my firearm, I will grab a trusty bar stool. The perfect weapon for any weapon need, from repelling flying sharks, to casual home usage. Never leave your trusty bar stool at home. I know a lot of people say \\'it\\'s bad but good\\' but looking at this \\'film\\' it makes \\'The Room\\' more like a seriously bad film. Tommy Wiseau\\'s film is hilariously bad because it tries to be dramatic and emotional but it fails badly there was no feel of intention there. This film is just intentionally bad and you just know it\\'s going to suck because of its simple title and movies like that just gives \\'Great bad movies\\' a bad name. The whole concept of the story is just ridiculous and the acting is bland and there\\'s many plot holes like the mother telling the boyfriend not be rude and yet she\\'s trying to force her ex-husband out of the house. The movie is just a fad and although there\\'s a sequel that will be likely to fade as well like this movie. You have probably seen a whole bunch of reviews saying that it\\'s so bad it\\'s good. Well it\\'s so bad it\\'s worse than bad.Do not waste your time with this movie. There is no continuity between scenes, one second it\\'s flooding then in the next scene the streets are dry. The acting is terrible, the special effects are less than special.Lastly, poor Tara, she had some good movies under her belt, but this is the latest in a downward spiral for her acting career. It seems like she has been taking acting lessons from the rest of the cast because her performance is no better than the rest.Please watch something else. I beg you. I only wish this movie had been released to Drive-In theaters and been promoted on a twin bill with any other low rent/grade/brow cinematic masterpiece from the ill human beings at SyFy.To paraphrase Elvis Costello- I just don\\'t know where to begin.. Wooden acting, special effects from a Midwestern middle school science fair, a script that veers wildly from insipid to bizarre to total nonsense, actors that should face summary execution if they made only scale and still cashed their paychecks, a director that makes Ed Wood look like Ingmar Bergman. In other words a glorious triumph of B-grade movie making..As you take in the visceral train wreck (that could only be better if released in grainy 8mm), you are reminded of what good/bad scifi is. Absolute suspension of disbelief, pure enjoyment of the insanity of it all, and a curious thought that you could not enjoy life more if you were shotgunned Thai sticks by Godzilla himself..It is the generic Twinkie of B movies. Made all the better by the fact that it IS a cheap, sickeningly self indulgent wad of fluff that you feel doubly guilty of consuming.God help me I do love it so.... Listen--there is a certain kind of spectrum of movies. There are the hugely-budgeted blockbusters, and then the b-movies, which live in their own little world. You cannot watch a b-movie with the same eyes that you do a blockbuster. If you do, and if you are overly critical, you will probably not enjoy it, and Asylum Studios will just laugh at you.I honestly loved this movie! The difference between this and a lot of b- movies is that this film was decently fast-paced--in a lot of low-budget films, they make a ridiculous monster or something, but barely ever show it, and just have lame dialogue in-between. But in this film, the action never stopped. There were flying sharks munching people at least every ten minutes or so. It was fun, and you could tell the people who made it had fun. For the budget that this movie had, I was very impressed. It was quite a ride! Acting... sub-par. CGI... laughable. This movie is so bad that it keep you laughing hysterically until the end. Physics, science, and common sense are all out the window though so don\\'t expect it to make sense. Why? Because SyFy. One of the most curious things is what type of storm we\\'re experiencing. Is it a hurricane? A tornado? A monsoon? Or just Superman? Maybe its all of the above. The cast is surprising though. Steve (Ian Ziering)from 90210 and Tara Reid may be better off turning their resume in to a temp agency at this point, but they do the best they can with campy dialogue. If there is a sequel, I hope it is called Sharknado v. Squidphoon. The scene where Fin cuts his way out of a 20,000 lb flying great white and then reaches back in to pull out the girl who was eaten in midair after falling out of a helicopter trying to throw a propane bottle into an F5 tornado had me laughing so hard the room turned black. It was the defining moment of the show. I\\'m supposed to write ten lines of text for this review, but I don\\'t even think the script for the show was that long. I had to give it 7 out of ten because it was so bad it was good, then it swung to just being bad, but backed up to being so bad it was good again. My family bought snacks, beer and soda to watch this show. We laughed and groaned and made fun of it the whole way through. Is it the worst movie ever made? No. The cinematography is not half-bad, it\\'s not afraid to kill off some key characters, and Jaason Simmons is somewhat worth rooting for. But is it awful? Absolutely. Many viewers who have assisted this garbage in attaining some sort of pathetic cult status insist the amateur CGI, bad acting and ridiculous premise is what makes this film so fun to watch. No\\x85 just\\x85 no. There are parts that really stink of effort, which completely ruins any chance of this movie having any sort of it\\'s-so-bad-it\\'s-good quality. There are many turkeys to choose from for Bad Movie Night, and SHAKRNADO isn\\'t one of them. You\\'ll make better use of your time staring at a blank wall.* (out of four) THIS IS STUPID. There, I think that sums it up. All this film does is introduce characters,then kill them off seconds later. It starts with Fin (Yes, he\\'s called fin)and three other people so incredibly devoid of any character that I can\\'t remember any of them. Then, all it does is slowly introduce redshirts for the sole purpose of killing them off. One of the characters who sadly survived is one who has no problems leaving innocent school kids to die. There\\'s also this teacher, who\\'s death scene is just painful. Parts of the Hollywood sign fly towards him, and he engages in this really pathetic thing were he doges them. Yeah, every single one heads towards this guy. It looks like some crappy quick time event from some bad video game. He gets crushed by some rebar that clearly landed nowhere near him. We also get some completely pointless scene were they run through a red light for NO reason, and the police chase them. They give up chasing after 5 seconds, and it\\'s not relevant to the plot in anyway, except it shows this nitro-boost feature, which of course comes back at the ending. The only good thing this movie does is kill off the annoying woman who exists solely for the love plot tumour. But then, in the finale, the protagonist is eaten by a shark, but chainsaws his way out. Oh, and the annoying woman who was eaten well over ten minutes ago? He pulls her out, and she survives. And that is why the director of this film must be sent to hell for his crimes against the human race. Or should I say, who goes to Long John Silvers and expects lobster? In either case, I think there may be a disconnect between expectations and the reality of the promised delivery. Put your mind aside for a moment, unfocus your eyes, and dismiss anyone who seems like they\\'d be a member of the know-it-all audience before the show starts. It\\'s a romp of sharks, tornadoes, weapons (some even improvised), crazy situations that produce even crazier solutions, camptastic back-stories with one-liner dialogs to boot and enough cherry syrup to supply a 1950\\'s soda fountain for the whole decade. If you have a checklist of all the well known B-movie elements, you\\'d complete it by the end for sure. That is what it was designed to be, and that\\'s what it proudly provides. So, are you down with embracing the absurd? I do believe this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I know this channel is infamous for terrible movies and I have seen most of them.So I came in with very low expectations and I was still stunned. I have never seen a movie so chopped up and put together.One minute there are tidal waves of water &amp; tornadoes, dry streets and sunny skies the next.The surfing scene is a great example of what I\\'m talking about. Everything is beyond preposterous and no explanations given. The budget for this movie must have been a Lincoln and a pack of gum. It\\'s actually so bad, that it\\'s not even funny. You\\'re too busy going wha tha fa to even laugh.The terrible and ridiculous ending is the perfect way for this movie to end. Instead of frequently used movie adjectives such as \"Riveting,\" or \"Unbelievable,\" the \"Sharknado\" billboard uses the descriptive words, \"Enough Said.\" I don\\'t know why but these words make me laugh, and they set the tone for this ridiculously silly movie. I love scary movies when the enemy is not a real threat to me or any other movie watcher. Therefore, I don\\'t watch stalker or slasher movies.There are sharks coming from every direction when they\\'re catapulted into the sky by a freak storm that carries them everywhere. No place is safe.Common sense is rarely used in this type of movie. I\\'ll admit that \"The Birds\" is in a different league, but I always wonder why no one thinks to wear a hat that could deter at least some of the birds for awhile, especially a construction hat or football helmet. In Sharknado the sharks are vicious and hungry. Why no one in this movie can get away from these sharks baffles me. There are so many that its easy to get pelted by one. Pelted and then chewed, even swallowed. No one seems to remember that sharks can\\'t walk or run on the land. Once they land on the ground, they would be stuck without rushing water to move them along.. Our hero---played by Ian Ziering---and his family and friends must take a proactive approach to fight these big fish while waiting for the torrential storms to pass.This movie has some great foreshadowing. You can predict that certain characters will not be around much longer. But who cares? If you don\\'t mind watching people get dismembered, or even swallowed, you may enjoy this movie as much as I did. From the prestige Asylum Films comes another one of their films with a bad premise and laughably simplistic characters with no depth. The difference? This film is so bad that it becomes entertaining to watch. As a hurricane picks up sharks from the Pacific Ocean, it continues to head for California. There, a small band of survivors must try and escape and find the leader of the group\\'s son in all of the chaos. Using bad effects and cuts to actual sharks captured on film by other people, the sharks are jokes in this film and takes away and tension that they might bring. But whatever, it is funny to watch a bunch of sharks being tossed through windows and into streets to eat people.There is a lot of setup with no pay off or things that just sort of happen. One of the characters (Cassie Scerbo) is in love with the main character but instead is with his son in the end without any explanation which just comes across as random.While extremely corny and bad, you can enjoy laughing at the awful animated sharks, the bad dialog and characters, and the strange ideas that the characters have during the course of the film. Let\\'s not be coy here, this movie just plain sucks. The acting is awful, the premise was created by a little boy on a sugar rush, the special effects give James Camron an ulcer and the writer doesn\\'t understand the concepts of plot and story. BUT, that\\'s why it\\'s fun to watch.You don\\'t watch a film with a title like \"Sharknado\" for a well conceived story and human drama. You watch it for tornadoes that are carrying sharks...and this movie gives it to you in the worst, and cheapest, way possible. This movie is perfect for getting together with friends and laughing at the bad special effects, millions of continuity errors, Ian Ziering acting like this is his comeback role, Tara Reid giving about as much effort as one can give if they were paid in coupons to Subway and the fact that literally not a single character reacts properly or question why all of a sudden there are tornadoes with sharks in them forming. They actually act like they\\'ve seen this before.It\\'s really brilliant in how bad it is! The title should have been a heads-up for me. Sharknado is undoubtedly one of the most painfully stupid movies I have seen in a long time. The dialog is pin-headed, events and actions repeatedly defy the laws of nature and physics and some of the more dramatic moments were actually laugh-out-loud funny. A lame and overly ambitious mishmash of Jaws meets Twister meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Sharknado\\'s greatest and most enduring value will likely be the comic relief it provides. Just because the movie takes itself too seriously doesn\\'t mean YOU have to! If nothing else, it could make for an entertaining pizza-and-beer B (or C or D)-movie night with the gang. When waterspouts meet sharks they form the Perfect Storm of TERROR!! Just kidding! If you\\'re looking for terror you\\'ll have to look someplace else. This movie is as stupid as its title implies! I don\\'t think Syfy is even trying to make good movies anymore. This flick looks and feels like some very silly people devoted an entire weekend to producing it. It fails on almost every level possible. It\\'s impossible to say whether the producers intended this thing to be funny or not but I guarantee that you\\'ll find yourself laughing at what you see on the screen. The \"Oh Come ON!\" moments abound in this crapsterpiece! In fact, if you can lay your hands on a DVD of this thing, the last half hour is not to be missed. You literally will not believe that anyone would ever commit something this idiotic to celluloid. So, if you\\'re looking for spine-tingling chills, then avoid this movie at all costs. If, however, MST3K-worthy crap is your cup of tea then getcha a big bowl of popcorn, settle back and enjoy! If have waited so many years for a movie as cheesy and campy as Sharknado!!!! I mean who wants to watch the academy award winning Lincoln on pay per view when the SyFy channel offers a gem that contains drug dealers, a former surf superstar who while a bar owner is a meterologist and super hero who can without help can repel overpasses and save a school bus load of school kids and be a counselor to his tortured, rejected teenage daughter,who can swim in blood soaked mansions &amp; fight his way out of a shark with a chainsaw, there\\'s the girl who looks like a stripper who is pretty bad ass with a shotgun (yes you can kill a huge shark flying through the air with a shotgun and a cue stick for that matter), a one dimensional ex wife (numbly played by the ever zombie like Tara Reid) don\\'t forget the lecherous old drunk who rescues Golden Retrievers with bar stools, yes y\\'all, Bar Stools!!! Forget the current gun law legislation, let\\'s outlaw bar stools, you can kick some serious shark ass with that! It just can\\'t get any better folks!!!!!This was the most fun I have had watching a movie in years and I am not even joking. I mean, sharks attacking people in little to no water, a giant roller coaster squashing people, tornado\\'s with sharks flying around, where were the octopus\\', jellyfish, whales, etc? It was so bad it is FANTASTIC!!!!! Please make a sequel, PLEASE! Maybe sat in the south and call it Gatornado or Crococaine.',\n",
       " 'I first saw this film in 1978, my father took me to see it with my brothers at the drive-in as a double feature with \"Every Which Way But Loose.\" It\\'s a movie that I have never forgotten. It combines brilliantly heart gripping surfing action, heart wrenching emotions, and heart uplifting humour, all set against the back-drop of the Vietnam War, teenagers growing up, the wisdom of elders (Bear) and of course, the surfing.I\\'ve never surfed a minute of my entire life (although whenever I watch this, I feel like I should), so don\\'t think of this as a \"surf movie\". It simply is an excellent piece of cinematic history that you will feel you missed on if you never see it.Recommended with 2 thumbs way way way up. \"This movie is too good for surfers.\" Quentin Tarantino was asked about \"Big Wednesday\" once and this was his answer. Tarantino grew up in southern California and surfers, he says, were mean to him and his friends. Tarantino, however, knows a good movie when he sees one. This truly is Hollywood\\'s \"perfect wave\", the only time the surf culture was portrayed accurately in a studio film. The surf community consistently refers to this film with reverence, citing it\\'s depiction of the \"soul\" of surfing as being worthy of their hallowed endeavors in the water. After years of Frankie and Annette or, God forbid, Keanu Reeves, this is one they can be proud of. Writer-director John Milius was a surfer himself referring to it again in his most celebrated screenplay for \"Apocalypse Now\" (\"Charlie don\\'t surf!\"). One of the keys to this film\\'s authenticity is the fact that the three stars did a lot of their own surfing. Actually seeing their faces as they stand up for a ride is a bonus. William Kaat, Jan-Michael Vincent and Gary Busey (actually pretty big names from this era) were accomplished surfers, Busey learning for the role. The fine cast is rounded out by cuties Lee Purcell and Patti d\\'Arbanville and Sam Melville as the mystical mentor Bear. Keep your eyes peeled for legendary surfer Gerry Lopez, \"Perry Mason\"\\'s Barbara Hale, future Freddy creep Robert Englund, Larry Talbot from \"Miami Vice\" and Charlene Tilton and Steve Kanaly who both ended up on \"Dallas\". If you ever had a group of friends who did stuff together, you\\'ll find this film has a lot of depth and soul. As Matt says after riding Big Wednesday \"we drew the line\". The three friends have validated the thing that consumed them as young men, that is riding waves and promising to be together when the big one hit. But they also acknowledge the need to embrace adulthood and put surfing where it should be. As Bear himself said \"nobody surfs forever\". Sad but true. It applies to all of us, no matter what we do. What is it about Big Wednesday that inspires so much affection? I won\\'t repeat the many tributes that have been made here, and yes, I was a surfer, and yes, this is in my top five of all time movies, and yes, I watch it about once every eighteen months.But something others don\\'t seem to mention much is the perfect score that Basil Poledouris wrote for the movie, sound which echoes and complements the action throughout, and reminds me strongly of artists and music of the time like Jack Nitzches \"Lonely Surfer\", and \"Beyond the Break\". Not, for heaven\\'s sake, the Beach Boys or Jan and Dean.But isn\\'t that a big part of good movies? When music, image and story all combine? (Discuss)The other four of my five are \"Andrei Rublev\", \"If...\" \"The Piano\" \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" Down the street from my house is a restaurant/bar called RT\\'s Longboard grill, which was opened by family as a tribute to a brother lost at sea. Adorning the bamboo laden walls, amongst yesteryear photos, boards, posters, and memorabilia, are TV screens which endlessly show classic surfing movies. The feeling one gets in this environment is similar to what one gets watching Big Wednesday. This isn\\'t a surf movie in the sense of the word. You see, the trendy, infantile children that drunkenly roam the streets of Pacific Beach (where I live in San Diego)for the most part don\\'t have souls, sadly, living in the very town in which many surf legends have been born. Hard pressed to find are the light hearted conversations over a good burger, malt, and a good set of waves. Big Wednesday contains such an epic story. OK... I seem bitter. It\\'s because I am. I know the word \"dude\" and a nose covered in sunscreen is an easy stereotype... but the spiritual life altering experience behind surfing is most often misunderstood. What is your passion? Do you have one? It may be your children. It may be horses. It may be hockey. But no matter what goes wrong in your life, or who dies or what happens, at the core is your passion (translated : spirituality)... something pure. At the heart of this movie is this purity... and after the draft, relationships, addictions, and just plain adolescent insanity, the characters find that their friendship is still alive because of a common love. Don\\'t try and make too much sense of this review. This isn\\'t a restaurant review. I can\\'t explain the feeling nor would I expect the 95% of America that doesn\\'t live near a surf-able wave to get it...just watch the movie. This is a great film. I won\\'t say that everyone would like it, because there is always someone who will hate it. But I love this movie and cannot imagine hating it. I watch it again and again, mostly for Jack who is wonderful in his personality and development. I can\\'t rate this highly enough. The surfing scenes are spectacular, and watching the characters slowly mature and try to cope with life as an adult is always worth watching. Seeing Matt in particular struggle with his unwanted hero status and seeing his friends grow up, move away or die is really something to see. What he would have done without the capable, beautiful, indefatigable Peggy is anyone\\'s guess. However, I must say that you either get it or you don\\'t. A rite of passage film comparable to Stand By Me. The film follows the lives of three men through their late teens and twenties during the troubled period of American history that was the Vietnam war. The bond between these men is exemplified by their shared love for surfing and one another. With creative photography, Jan Michael Vincent (of Airwolf fame), Gary Busey (who makes a sneaky surfing appearance again in Point Break), and William Katt (who went on to star in such films as House) doing much of their own surfing, complemented by a professional team of surfing stunt doubles including Jerry Lopez make this one of the surfing all-time classics along-side Bruce Browns 1966 Endless Summer. Whether you\\'re into surfing or not, you\\'ll enjoy this for its story, feel good factor, and of course the surfing footage. Watch it. The lives of some California surfers from the early \\'60s to the \\'70s.Who should have been cast: Jan-Michael Vincent or Jeff Bridges? Well, in retrospect, Bridges might have drawn more acclaim to this picture. But Vincent nails the role, and although not as big of a name, he was the man for the job.John Milius is known for his conservative, manly films. This does not really mesh with the idea of the surfer, at least until you see this film. Then you understand that the surfer - to Milius - is a libertarian at heart, fighting against the \"lifeguard state\".The film features great music, great fights, and a nice cameo from a then-unknown Robert Englund. And heck, this is Gary Busey in his prime.Interestingly, because the film takes place during the Vietnam War, this acts like something as a counterpoint to \"Apocalypse Now\", another Milius film. What message are we to get from the two combined? Gary Busey\\'s career high as the insane \"Masochist\" with the irrisistable quote \"More Beer!\".  Okay, this is a little patchy, but it\\'s beautifully shot and has that old fashioned innocence that most modern teen films lack. The surfing rules and the leading trio is well played.  Oh and I forgot to mention, the entire narration is by none other than Elm street\\'s Fred Kreuger, a.k.a Robert Englund, which just makes it uber-cool in my minds eye; but I am biased. A great feel-good movie from when movies still felt pretty good. A movie about surf, friendship and the hardness in growing up.The movie has great surf pictures, great surfers (Gerry Lopez himself), it has a beautiful script and was very well directed.I think this movie is already a classic for surfers and non-surfers... ;-)I watch the movie in VHS long ago, and i´m waiting for the DVD (next month) I much prefer a movie that looks great to one with great dialogue. So with this movie I was pretty much satisfied. OK the acting can be a little iffy at times (\"those kids do look up to you\" said in a bit of an over the top way) but the story line, humour, and fights (very enjoyable at the party, not as much in Mexico because of the more serious tone) are all very good.But this film really excels in the shots of the ocean and surfing. They are quite simply beautiful.I don\\'t really understand why this film did so badly but heh it seems to be more accepted now. There have been many feature length films out of Hollywood that have latched on to the subject of surfing.  Endless Summer is the definitive classic, but it falls under the category of a documentary.  The others are somewhere between comedy and drama. Some are cult classics and others are just plain silly 60\\'s teeny movies.  North Shore is a cult classic, but as a drama and a story it is basically lame, but I still like North Shore alot.  Big Wednesday is truly credible.  The story is great, the characters are great and it is worthy of respect as cinema.  It is a kind of timeless story which happens to be told using the backdrop of Southern California surf culture. Those who live outside of this world may not fully apprieciate all of the nuances present or understand the surfer-surf-surfboard relationship.  Now as to locations for filming:  Most of the scenes are shot at Cojo Point, which is in Santa Barbara County, CA.  Cojo is located in a remote part of this county and is not accessible by any public means other than by boat (the beach front is all private land).  Other scenes were shot in El Salvador at a place called La Libertad.  It isn\\'t always easy to tell them apart.  Both breaks are well above average in quality when on.  The scenes with the more textured water that has a wilder appearance are probably La Libertad.  The final and climactic scene on \"Big Wednesday\" is at Sunset Beach on Oahu\\'s north shore.  This is where Rick Kane first paddles out with Occy and Alex in North Shore.  Sunset is a heavy wave breaking on an outside reef that can hold size and is no place for the inexperienced.  Gerry Lopez does a reasonable job surfing Sunset with his back to the wave.  Gerry was better known for his exploits at Pipeline, where he could surf facing the wave.  Surfers like Billy Hamilton, Peter Townend and Ian Cairns were probably giving a stronger account of themselves at Sunset in the final scene.  John Milius was never a surfer of any particular note growing up around Malibu, so I would question the autobiographical basis.  He probably witnessed this type of stuff, but I don\\'t know about actually participating. I first saw this when it came out. As a surfer, I looked forward to it, and was disappointed. I just watched it today on Netflix and was even more disappointed! The unbelievable house party scene was probably what really highlighted how Hollywood fantasizes too much about how they think either the world is, was, or should be. It was kind of funny to see Gary Bussey play essentially himself in this movie, after rewinding in my head the news stories of the past 30 years about him. The Endless Summer movies still are the best at depicting what surfing is about, despite the many corny scenes thrown into them. The attempts of Big Wednesday to depict teens maturing into adults just fell flat. I wish I hadn\\'t wasted another 2 hours watching this movie again. The surfing sequences are what make this movie, some of the waves on Big Wednesday at the end look too huge and powerful to be real, and the sight of these men standing at the foot of them on their puny little boards, battling to outrun the awesome power of the water crashing down, is real heart-gripping stuff. The tale of a group of friends drifting through the sixties and seventies, getting into scrapes, having parties, trying to avoid Vietnam and doing all that stuff sixties movies live for, is well enough done, though the script gets a bit cliche-heavy at some points. The episodic format, a series of brief snapshots taken from various moments over a spread of ten years or so, helps capture the rambling nature of these people\\'s lives, and gives an insight on how much things change and yet stay the same between a gang of old friends as the times move on and the world turns. Katt fares well as the narrator and core, as is Stringfellow Hawk as the former champ surfer, and Busey gives his normal crazy shouty brilliance, but the surf takes the honours. \"Big Wednesday\" (1978) is a film that was made for baby boomers. Writer/director John Milius was born in 1944 and the material draws on a ten year span of his life from the early 1960\\'s to the early 1970\\'s. Aside from needing a span of time to qualify as a coming-of-age saga, it was hoped that the long time span would enable it to connect with the entire range of boomers (birth dates from 1945-1963). Almost anyone born during those years will find things in the film they relate to-even shadow boomers with just the second-hand exposure provided by their older siblings. Younger viewers should enjoy the spectacular surfing sequences and might find the other stuff an interesting history lesson. Milius is one of the so-called young auteur directors of the 70\\'s (Coppola, Lucus, Spielberg, Scorsese, De Palma). Unlike the others he did very little after 1984, the year he released \"Red Dawn\", an embarrassingly moronic and histrionic right-wing propaganda film that alerted an unsuspecting world to his extremist political views. Hollywood insiders already knew about this and the Coen Brothers would use him as a model for John Goodman\\'s character in \"The Big Lebowski\". But \"Big Wednesday\" is his masterpiece and it is unlikely that any other writer/director could have brought this story to the screen this effectively. Unfortunately its surfer subject matter did not draw many non-enthusiasts to the theatre; even though the film is a lot more than surfing, containing a very original universal message about the process of living and changing. Low box office led to a re-edit for pay- television, with the more philosophical content was taken out. The current DVD and VHS are of this shorter version, so if you saw the \"Big Wednesday\" during its theatrical release you will be somewhat disappointed. Structured like a four act play with each transition moving the action ahead a couple of years, \"Big Wednesday\" follows three young surfers in the LA area (Jan-Michael Vincent, William Katt and Gary Busey). Each plays a talented surfer with Vincent\\'s character approaching legendary status. Surfing plays a big part in their lives (Bruce Surtees\\' cinematography provides some of the most stunning views of the sport you are likely to ever see) but much of the film takes place away from the beach; with scenes of parties, the military induction center, Tijuana, family life, and romance (a full range of what growing up in southern California was all about). Milius\\' treatment of surfing is reverential and sometimes even mystical, with a sweeping musical score and a local character (Bear) who is a kind of guru for the sport. In a scene cut from the television version Bear explains the origin and significance of the \"Big Wednesday\" title. Somehow Milius gets all this right and the film transcends what might have been a pretentious exercise in sport glorification. Milius pays homages to John Ford, initially with the appearance of Ford regular \"Hank Worden\" as the shopping cart man. Later you see Ford\\'s \"The Searchers\" (1956) reflected in the relationship between Jack and Peggy, including a scene where Peggy cradles Jack\\'s army uniform in the same manner Martha cradled Ethan\\'s coat. A man and a woman who have had to subordinate their love for each other because of an overriding loyalty.The final scene is truly special as the three main characters manage a convergence for a final day of surfing together, a scene that recalls the freedom and awe of their teenage years, contrasting it with how removed they have gotten from this former way of life. Anyone who has had to choke back their emotions after a nostalgic rush reminds them of what they will never have again, will be moved my this wonderful sequence. Then again, what do I know? I\\'m only a child. I can\\'t say enough good things about this film. It\\'s poignant, funny, intelligent, and beautifully filmed. It really captures the feeling of the California surf culture quite well. It makes you feel like you can hear the waves outside as soon as the movie ends. Perhaps the beginning surfer party goes on a bit long, and yes there is a Tijuana scene that\\'s a bit pointless too, but the movie gets stronger as it goes along. There is an interesting Vietnam War crossover in a recruiting \\'barracks\\' - the surf guys come up with all sorts of outrageous ways to get out of going to Vietnam. Some of their antics work (like a Nazi regalia outfit, or JMV\\'s injured leg), and others don\\'t (Waxer\\'s failed \\'homosexual\\'). The crux of the movie really relies on William Katt and Jan Michael Vincent. They seem to be the closest buddies in the film, and the movie revolves around their changing and sometimes turbulent relationship - the common thread being their love of surfing. William Katt (Jack) is more of a straight-arrow character, whereas Vincent\\'s (Matt) is frighteningly like his true off screen persona (a drunk who ends up sleeping on the beach - which actually happened to him!). Jack goes off to war willingly - and Matt stays behind, uncomfortable with the strangeness of the 60\\'s culture around him. Jack returns from the war in one piece - and the first thing he does is go out to the ocean to find Matt and surf. The film ends in the 70\\'s with the \\'Big Wednesday\\' moment - a gigantic swell on the coast. All three buddies (can\\'t forget about the unforgettable Gary Busey in this!) all meet at their usual beach and surf better than ever. They part ways at the end. Jan Michael Vincent is very good in this film, but in a quiet way. He\\'s a pensive character. He has a great emotional scene at a cemetery, mourning a lost friend in the war. His brooding eyes carry the film - and you are always watching him and his reactions throughout. He also actually does a lot of his own surfing in the film, as did Busey and Katt. Katt is excellent as well - I wish he\\'d done more films like this one! I\\'m watching this movie for the third time.  I leave a lot time in between repeats, in this case 5 years.  It\\'s a good example of how art reflects reality in respect to the characters.  One of the goofs for the movie isn\\'t in the movie but in the filming locations listed by imdb.  It says this movie about surfing and surfers was all filmed in \"El Paso, Texas\"  This is funniest thing I have ever read on this site.  You will like this movie even if you don\\'t like surfing.  If you\\'ve already seen it, see it again, it\\'s worth it. This is one of my favourite films of all time. It has such a feel good factor that I get it out and watch it at least three times a year and have done since I was kid, surfing with my friends in Cornwall in the early eighties. Following the lives of three friends from 1962 to the \"great swell\" of 1974, this is a beautifully shot movie with warm characters that you grow to really care about. From the opening credits with, believe it or not, the wonderfully mellow voice-over provided by Robert England, to the final mega surfing scene the story pulls you in with it\\'s glorious scenery, great acting and superbly shot surfing scenes. Based around Milius\\'s own experiences this is a classic and in my opinion, the best surfing film ever made. A solid film for surfing fans. Typical of John Milius\\' other work, it has it\\'s fair share of heavy handed social commentary from a quintessentially American point of view. I found the two hour story to drag at times, but this really is more a dramatic film than an action or adventure. All three male leads are played very well and convincingly, in particular Jan Michael Vincent has a strong screen presence here, done when he still had talent. Busey is his typical off the wall self and good for some minor laughs. Joe Spinell has a cameo. This film really begs to be seen on a giant screen, so the fact that I have only seen it on my pathetic 31\" screen makes me realize I am missing some of the effect of the epic surfing footage. There is a strong anti-hippie bias in the film which is great, and the comical scene when each guy is trying to figure out which way to get out of the Vietnam draft is probably the highlight for me. This movie makes a nice companion piece with Point Break, but watch this first as it is much slower. Big Wednesday has major weaknesses as a coming of age film which are made up for by some excellent surfing scenes, particularly towards the end. The plot, or whatever passes for a plot is trite and contrived - quite direction-less. Ideas and coming of age memories of the script writers seem to have been banded together with poor sense of characterization. The idea of showing a character aging by having a ridiculous mustache doesn\\'t show a lot of maturity.However, surfing is at the soul of this film. The last 20 minutes are so good that even those not familiar with the sport would be intrigued. I can understand this being a cult favorite for surfers. The Vietnam drafting section was also something I hadn\\'t seen in a film before and I found it educational. SPOIL ALERT!  Big Wednesday is perhaps the most underrated film of all time-- it is simply an unbelievable film.  It is a film that depends on each scene, each character and each line spoken to make the story work.  I have never seen a film with such a great cast of characters and such a feeling of change.  If this film were to be summarized briefly it would be rendered a film that showcases the effects of change.  The beginning era in 1962 shows the era of innocence, partying, sex, and the era of Bear.  In the early scenes, Bear is looked up to by all the surfers as a God... a man who knows all.  Perhaps the greatest two scenes in the beginning come when Bear is making the \"Big Wave board\" and speaking of the day when \"a swell so big will wipe everything that came before it\".  Of course, the board is ridden during the famous Big Wednesday of 1974, just as Bear had predicted.  The other great scene is the party scene.  Amongst my friends and myself, we now refer to awesome parties as \"Big Wednesday parties\", but of course none of them can compare.  The second era shows Matt as the drunk, and Jack as the straight-laced lifeguard.  Bear is prosperous as ever, running his huge store despite earlier being upset at \"living like an inlander\".  A key scene comes when Matt the drunk goes to Bear for advice, and Bear again proves his wisdom.  A major element of change can be seen when in 1974 it is Bear who is the drunk and Matt is attempting to give him advice.  Perhaps the one line that Bear says which shows his major change is \"I\\'m just a garbage man!\" after being queried about his surfing.  While everything changes, the only thing that remains constant is Matt, Leroy and Jack\\'s intense friendship.  I could go on forever, but I\\'d rather leave it to others to watch despite my spoils.  This film will make you embrace youth and friendship like no other picture could ever do.  10/10 This is a coming-of-age drama, complete with hokey voice-over intro in style of Stand by Me, about a group of lads growing up in a surfing town in the late 1950s into the 60s. I gave up after an hour, though it failed the 20 minute rule where at that point I realise it hadn\\'t captured my imagination. My problem is the writing- it\\'s very broad. In the first half hour there are two extended fistfights in the style of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, you half expect a fiddle to be playing in the background. Just one punch could kill someone, but no one has a broken nose, cut lip or anything. One fight takes place at a party, where it\\'s already been established that the long-suffering mum is upstairs reading a book and rolling her eyes at the loud music. But when it all kicks off downstairs, and someone is thrown through a glass window, she\\'s nowhere to be seen. The Yanks in it - I was gonna say they\\'re too American, which sounds bad. But you know The Graduate, when Benji is trying to locate Elaine in the final reel, and meets some jocks in a shower, and struggles to relate to them a bit. It\\'s like the characters are all like that. After an hour I gave up on this. My guess is that if you\\'ve lived it, this film would be a nostalgia trip for you, as you could fill in the details where the writing doesn\\'t bother. This movie is it all; everything; it has something for everyone, including a tanned and toned Young Michael Vincent. There is action, a romance, funny moments, some action, good script and stunning surfing footage, as well as plenty of action, but not too much. Yes, Big Wednesday is a classic \\'coming out age\\' story set in Vietnam era America involving a group of school friends who love to surf. As is typical of these types of films we get a group of friends on the verge of growing up, setting off on their own path, possibly parting ways, and having one last kick ass summer. It reminds me of my own last kick ass summer with my friends. There was me, Neville, Bobert, Shawsy, Wee Scott, Bunter, Fitz, Simon, Murph, Stoat, Biggles, Rodger, as well as a few girls like Jem, Lee, Gree, Corky and of course my little brother Andy tried to tag along. That fool Brendan and his scumbag mates tried to spoil it on us, wherever we went, he was there to, looking at us with his eyes. Sure enough the exams were done, we knew that we would all be getting jobs or going off to university, or being mauled by bears, or moving away. None of us were going to fight in Vietnam (though Neville claimed he had already been and would have frequent flashbacks), and none of us were into surfing, but you can see the comparison.Jan Michael and Co- they just wanted to ride one last big wave, but the real wave (the Tsunami of life) was washing towards them at an unstoppable rate, unavoidable and inevitable. Crazy Gary Busey also stars in this Milius film (Milius would go onto wide spread acclaim and fame with Knightriders, having already made a name writing The Godfather), and Vincent would go off to become TV\\'s biggest star in Airwoof. The army comes to town to draft any young, fit men into the army- any injured or crazy types had to stay at home (this is based on actual events) so Busey stayed and got a job stealing motorcycles, all the smart guys could go to college or become a military strategist. The remainder of the gang, including Vincent go off to War and experience some terrifying events- being locked in cages filled with water and rats, but no surfboards, and being forced to play Vietnam Roulette with each other. The game is thus: 5 cups are presented, each filled with same coloured liquid. The treat is that one of the liquids is actually so disease filled that as soon as it is swallowed the drinker begins to convulse, blood pours from every orifice and they eventually melt. Later they escape and before they go home they ask one request of one of their friends (a young Freddy Kruegger) who has now become their commanding officer- will you surf before we go home. He has however succumbed to the madness of war, wishes to stay, and heart breakingly replies \\'Charlie Don\\'t Surf!\\' This proved to be one of the pivotal moments in 70s cinema, and indeed in American History, signifying loss of innocence, tainting The American Dream, and squirting out the final puff from the spliff of the Hippy Movement and Freedom.I was fortunate enough to go off to University and subsequently get a 6 figure salary, some of my friends came along too, more went further afield, or stayed at home and began to fade away, losing the beautiful fire of youth that once burned ever so brightly. I sometimes wander through my home town now, and occasionally see one of the old gang across the street. I wave to them, but time and circumstance has been unkind to us, fate conspiring to gouge an impenetrable void between us. They don\\'t wave; they barely look; in fact, they don\\'t even recognise me. Who would have though that all those jokes we shared, all those lazy days walking through the forests together, all the sunsets we watched and the nights we hoped would never end, all those great times which would never come round again; who would have thought that now it is as if they have never happened at all? I refuse to give up though- I still chat with a few of them, those who made it. Some are married, heck- some even have kids! I know when we have a few drinks, I see the old glint in their eyes that our youth is still alive and well inside, it\\'s just having a lie down. Sure I have new friends now, but it\\'s our oldest ones that count most, those we shared our defining moments with. We don\\'t say anything; we don\\'t need to. We may have lost some along they way, but as long as there is at least one of us, we know we\\'ll be okay.Best Scene: The flashback to the group of friends hugging and laughing- when times were good. The slow motion, the smiles, the memories, the music. It is my life. I wish I could jump in, take off my shirt, and hug them too. John Milius\\'s militant conservatism is somewhat subdued in this movie, though the movie was clearly made with a sense of nostalgia for a time when women and African-Americans knew their subjugated place and stayed there, and when going off to die pointlessly in an immoral war was seen as heroic and poignant. It\\'s a film in which people who behave cruelly and stupidly are supposed to be viewed as charming. The script for the film is crude, predictable, and often unintentionally funny, especially in the portentous voice-over sections. The martial soundtrack, which tries to give the movie weight it otherwise lacks, is also unintentionally funny (I dare you not to laugh at the end when our three buddy-boy surfers march into the waves as to war, drums and trumpets blaring all up and down the beach). The performances are one-dimensional, though that\\'s probably more the fault of the script than the actors. On the up side, the bodies are beautiful. Jan-Michael Vincent takes his shirt off as often as possible (as he tended to do in his younger days), and William Katt\\'s youthful sculpted chest was a match for Vincent\\'s. There\\'s some great footage of water, and some fine surfing, though not enough for my taste. The climactic, final surf-scene is worth watching, despite the angsty bromance you have to endure to get there. It might be better with the sound off. This is one of my favorite movies. The story is well told, the characters work very well in the film and it\\'s beautifully shot.It is also home to one of the funniest scenes of all time from a movie - the draft/registration for vietnam. I won\\'t give it away, but it makes me laugh out loud everytime I see it. I can\\'t believe this movie has finally been released to DVD!  This is one of two or three VHS movies in my extremely large vault of VHS tapes that I\\'ll still dust off and view on my trusty old VCR. Not everyone will dig this movie.  You either have to be a fan of one of the actors or John Milius, had seen it when it was released, are an avid surfer with respect for the sport and its rich history, or you saw it at a time in your life that much like a familiar smell or an old song, it transports you back to a unique period of your life. Having grown up on the beaches of Southern California with a crew of friends, it\\'s hard not to think that this film was a collection of polaroids of our own lives. This film is supposedly a very personal and semi-autobiographic story of John Milius\\'.  His characters, settings, and music create an atmosphere that you feel you can  swim through.  This film is very nostalgic, and is a perfect coming of age story. There are so many peripheral characters that surround the three main leads, that it\\'s hard not to identify with one or many of them.  I think everyone has been, or has grown up with, these characters.  The crazy guy, the rebellious guy, the guy that is wise beyond his years, the mentor, the guy that everyone looks up to, the new girl, the popular girl, etc.  Kind of like Dazed and Confused, and its multitude of characters. The film itself is very dated and is rather hokey if none of what I\\'ve written thusfar relates to you.  But I will say that this movie has one of the best party/fight scenes of any movie I\\'ve ever seen (I have a BA in Film from SFSU, so I\\'ve seen a lot of them).  The Vietnam draft scene is a classic.  And watch for many early career cameos by Frank McRae and Robert Englund (yep, that\\'s Freddy with the keg tap).  Also note the sweet wave riding of some of surfing\\'s greats; Gerry Lopez, J. Riddle, Peter Townend, and Jacki Dunn.  John Milius has succeeded in recreating a time and place in surf history that can never be visited again; the innocence (and perhaps the naivete) of the time, the adventurous spirit of youth, the comraderie and adventures/misadventures of friends, and the pursuit of surfing for surfing (not for labels, social status, intimidation, or because \"it\\'s cool\"). This film should be required viewing for anyone surfing, or learning to surf today.  The beach, the waves, the environment should be a sense of therapy for life.  Growing up in Southern California, I know that no matter what kind of garbage life may throw my way; I still can drive down PCH and and mother ocean will be right there to make everything right again.Everytime I pop this film in and hear the soothing guitar picking, watch the friends cruising down the beach and surfing all day long, or tearing up a parent\\'s house with a party, I think of that same period of my life and look back with content.',\n",
       " 'Movies in the last years have become more uniform, more streamlined, particularly in the US. As a result, the film market is full of sleek, entertaining movies that the whole world goes to see, but these movies have nothing but harmless baby teeth. Fortunately, people like Lynch or Cronenberg still do movies that may be considered defective by most people, but that bite into the flesh with pointy canines. The Naked Lunch has very sharp teeth indeed. It\\'s supposed to be an adaptation from a William Burrough\\'s book, which doesn\\'t make sense anyway. It starts as the story of a failed writer whose wife becomes addicted to an insecticide powder... It goes downhill after this relatively sane and normal beginning. It\\'s a ride, a drug-induced nightmare full of horribly funny visions (the sort of visions that artists used centuries ago to represent hell). Anuses talk. Aliens sip alcohol in bars. People get impaled. Typewriters turn into bugs. Liquids ooze. You may say it\\'s flawed, or disgusting, or ridiculous, or boring. I saw it with someone who absolutely hated it. But the fact that this person still keeps talking about it 8 years after seeing it says a lot about the Naked Lunch, at a time when we tend to forget blockbusters a few hours after watching them. The Naked Lunch is here - in your mind - to stay. Naked Lunch seems to be just totally incomprehensible upon first viewing. However, after watching it again, you start to understand more and more. Upon multiple viewings, you really get a feel for what\\'s transpiring before your eyes.  The ultimate message is that it is really just a metaphor for heroin addiction, even though it\\'s so much more deeper than that.  It\\'s an intricate study of a man, William S. Burroughs, who was a heroin addict, and among other things one of the most significant Beat authors ever.  The film delves deeply into the psyche of Burroughs and takes you on a trip in his mind and your own.  There are touches of reality and many flashes of paranoia, and it is all done with style and grace.  Seriously one of the best films about an author, Naked Lunch will certainly stand the test of time against other films which may seem at first entertaining, but lose their luster upon multiple viewings.  Whereas, Naked Lunch, in my opinion, never will.  10 out of 10. \"Exterminate all rational thought. This is the conclusion I have come to\".So says Bill Lee, the central character of David Cronenberg\\'s adaptation of William Burroughs\\' bizarre novel \"Naked Lunch\". The film takes the novel, replaces the characters with Burroughs, his family, and his friends, and then gives them all the names of characters from the book anyway. Once you sort that conundrum out and stop thinking rationally you can begin to understand the film. But only begin. I don\\'t think there is any way to fully understand \"Naked Lunch\".Bill Lee is an exterminator who, along with his wife, has become addicted to bug repellent powder. One night, while on a bit of a bender, Bill accidentally shoots his wife, Joan, in the head during a game of William Tell. Following this, he uses the powder to go on a seemingly endless trip, ripe with sinister cabals, talking bugs, and journalistic endeavors.What the film theorizes is that this is actually the tale of how Burroughs wrote the book \"Naked Lunch\". Indeed, Burroughs did shoot his wife the way Bill does in the movie, but one wonders if Burroughs actually went on the trip we see in the film. \"Naked Lunch\" is akin to \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" in it\\'s over-the-top depiction of drug use as literary inspiration. \"Naked Lunch\" is actually a bit weirder to me than \"Fear and Loathing\", but I guess that\\'s the same as saying one Queer Eye Guy is gayer than another. How can you be sure and, in the end, what\\'s the difference? I\\'ll skip over trying to compare Burroughs\\' trip to Dr. Thompson\\'s. I think my brain would explode if I tried.David Cronenberg, cinematic master of the macabre, struck gold with \"Naked Lunch\". Here we have one of Cronenberg\\'s most fully realized fantasies. It\\'s sick, disturbing, and confusing and, in these ways, it almost reaches the level of \"VideoDrome\", Cronenberg\\'s true masterpiece and the most outright disturbing film I\\'ve ever seen. The creatures that Cronenberg dreamed up (based, of course, on Burroughs\\' warped ideas) are incredible. The seven-foot-tall Mugwumps (modeled after the physical appearance of Burroughs) creeped me out, and the half-beetle/half-typewriter creatures with talking sphincters are some of the grossest creatures I\\'ve ever seen on screen. These are things that Cronenberg delights in.Peter Weller finally escaped from the shadow of \"RoboCop\" with this film. Ironically, the characters are similar. Both Robo and Bill Lee are monotone speaking, emotionless people. The difference being that Robo is made from forklift parts held together with duct tape and glue and Bill is human. Or at least I think he is. Nothing is certain in \"Naked Lunch\". Weller captures William Burroughs expertly. Judy Davis shows her range in the dual role of Joan Lee, Bill\\'s wife, and Joan Frost, Bill\\'s imagined lover. Joan Lee is drug-addled and loose; Joan Frost is uptight and needs to be taught how to be free. Davis makes the two women so different that it\\'s almost impossible to tell it\\'s the same actress in both parts.If you like Burroughs, see this film. If you like Croneberg, see this film. If you want a simple, pleasant film...stay far away. :Naked Lunch\" is a pornographically perverted look at the complexities of drug abuse and the difficulties of the writing process. I don\\'t use the word pornographically lightly. This is as extreme a movie as I\\'ve ever seen, especially coming from the Hollywood system. It\\'s icky, it\\'s gross, it\\'s disturbing. It\\'s also a masterpiece. I\\'m always dubious when books I love are made into movies. They never QUITE translate and something is always lost. The idea of filming \\'Naked Lunch\\' is even more difficult than usual, because it isn\\'t really a novel with a coherent, chronological narrative, more a sequence of surreal, absurdly dark and funny \"skits\". As such it would be impossible to make a successful movie out of the raw material Burroughs created. Luckily Cronenberg (and who would have been better equipped to make this?) has cannily blended scenes from the book with incidents inspired by William Burroughs real life, and made it work. Very well. Fans of Burroughs are sure to be more satisfied with this than the more literal and less imaginative \\'Beat\\'. Non-fans will hopefully be inspired to read Burroughs\\' work after watching this. Peter Weller is perfectly cast as Bill Lee, and the supporting cast are also fine. I like most of Cronenberg\\'s output, and I would rate \\'Naked Lunch\\' as one of his most successful movies, and the best depiction so far of the Beat sensibility. Lots of people will hate this film, and some will love it. The bottom line is, if you enjoy, respect, or feel that you understand the work of William S. Burroughs, you should see this film. If you don\\'t know what I am talking about, you should probably not see this film. The following pedantic and potentially inflammatory review, like this film, pulls no punches and makes no apologies for itself. Read on if you dare. _________If any three of the following conditions apply see Naked Lunch:YOU 1. ...know what the term \"visual metaphor\" means.2. ...are a Burroughs, Kerouac or Ginsburg fan.2a. ...are not a fan, but know and respect Burroughs, Kerouac or Ginsburg3. ...can\\'t see how the book Naked Lunch could make a good film.4. ... believe that Peter Weller is an underrated actor.5. ...thought any of the following films were \\'lightweight\\': Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, The Last Wave, Heavenly Creatures, Dead Ringers.6. ...have lived in the New York area for 15 or more years.7. ...know the relationship between improvisational jazz, poetry, and modern art.8. ...think you understand what Andy Warhol was trying to do. 9. ... are curious about what the process of writing a novel is like. 10. ...spend a lot of time arguing with inanimate objects.11. ...without knowing the content of this film, can see a potential relationship between sexual ambivalence, guilt, paranoia, addiction, typewriters and over-sized talking insects.You should NOT see this film if any of the following apply:YOU1. ...consider homosexual love to be evil, wrong, and something you can not sympathize with or understand. 2. ...use the phrase \"he\\'s on drugs\" to explain behavior and ideas that do not make sense to you.3. ...do not like or respect Burroughs, Kerouac or Ginsburg, and you know who they are. 4. have a concept of challenging literature as the latest John Irving novel (no offense to Mr Irving intended - he\\'s easily as great as Burroughs, just sort of mainstream and pop). 5. ..like films which you can walk away from easily.6. ...don\\'t want to see any film which requires a second viewing to feel as if you\\'ve really got any of it.7. ...view films strictly as a form of entertainment.8. ...without knowing the content of this film, you can not imagine a potential relationship between sexual ambivalence, guilt, paranoia, addiction, typewriters and over-sized talking insects.9. ...don\\'t care to understand most of the following review. 10. ...consider ambiguity and loose ends in a film to be \"plot holes\" and consider any film which has them to be \\'flawed\\'._________________William S. Burroughs is widely regarded as one of America\\'s greatest writers of fiction. A friend and mentor to Jack Kerouac and Alan Ginsburg, Burroughs helped to create the genres of \\'beat\\' - American literary high modernism, and/or post-modernism. He provides highly tactile ironic, seductively repulsive descriptions of the everyday which are at once accurate, fragmented and surreal - in other words - Burroughs recreates the feeling and mood of his time and his experience with hermeneutic precision. Cronenberg\\'s Naked Lunch is an amalgamation of Cronenberg\\'s interpretation and experience of reading Burroughs, Burroughs own life, and Burrough\\'s legendary novel, Naked Lunch. There are six or more plots operating in six or more interacting layers throughout the film, and the action centers exclusively on Burrough\\'s alter-ego, Bill Lee, as he attempts to discover the relationships between all of these plots. The plots I identify (and an interested viewer will generally be able to identify many more that this) are Burrough\\'s relationship with Joan, Lee\\'s relationship with Joan, Lee\\'s drug addiction, Burrough\\'s drug addiction, Lee\\'s investigations into the secret society of drug trafficking at the edge of the world in Interzone, Burrough\\'s struggle to create/discover himself. However, the theme of the film is more an issue of the Lee/Burroughs character trying and, in the end, failing, to make sense of the connections between these plots. It is a very self-conscious, personal, brilliantly developed and visually intense film. Yet, despite its self-exposure and openness, the film maintains a certain distance from its audience, as if it has taken on the life given it by Cronenberg and Burroughs and established its own unique personality, which will keep its audience at a certain distance. To really appreciate this, you must watch the film at least a few times.It is especially significant that Burroughs gave his approval for this project. Burroughs\\' writing is intensely personal and artistic, and his willingness to allow Cronenberg to position himself and his experience of Burrough\\'s work within the film, and to decenter Naked Lunch is as powerful a testimony to Burrough\\'s own integrity as an artist as it is to Cronenberg\\'s vision. Most of the people who acted in this film really wanted to be involved in it and it shows. Ian Holm and Roy Scheider are always great. Peter Weller, a big Burroughs fan and a severely underrated actor gives what may be the performance of his lifetime, Judy Davis and Julian Sands are both perfectly cast and powerful in their roles. This films imagery is necessarily disturbing, disorienting, and, at times, quite comic. Very much in keeping with the feel of Burrough\\'s work.See it. You don\\'t have to like it to respect it. Films about writers and the creative process are not generally action-packed, but this unusual piece has plenty of incident. The action takes place largely inside the mind of  \"William Lee\" (William S. Burroughs) whose first book \"Junkie: Confessions of an Unredeemed Drug Addict\" dealt with his struggle against heroin addiction. \"The Naked Lunch\", set in the early 1950s, could be described as telling how that book came to be written. Lee does it tough. After \"drying out\" he has a job as a pest exterminator, killing cockroaches with powder from a cannister. He discovers that his wife Joan, still an addict, is shooting up with the bug powder and having sex openly with two of his literary friends, Hank and Martin. He then manages to kill her accidentally with his pistol (\"I guess it\\'s about time for our William Tell routine\"). He flees the country and washes up in \"Interzone\" (Tangier - then an \"international\" city).He tries to write but suffers from frequent hallucinations. He imagines his typewriter is a giant speaking bug whose mission is to act as his \"Interzone\" spyforce controller. He becomes involved with another expatriate literary couple, Tom and Joan Frost, and imagines that Tom is trying to kill his wife. Naturally he seduces the wife. Then he discovers he has a taste for gay sex, very easily indulged in locally, where there is a gorgeous willing boy such as Kiki ready to slide off the nearest bar stool. There is competition though from various other slimy types, including a rich gay predatory Swiss expatriate, Yves.Somehow, the book gets written, and Hank and Martin show up just as Lee bottoms out in psychotic despair. They help him piece it together and head off back to New York, leaving Lee to \"Interzone\" and his hallucinations.It takes a bit of discipline to watch this film - never has the creative process looked quite so destructive of the writer. Yet the whole thing has a lightness of touch about it. Lee never quite goes right over the edge and is able to observe himself with a certain amount of ironic detachment. At the same time, it is clear that the death of his wife has affected him deeply, both in terms of loss and guilt. The typewriter bugs are a cute touch. Burroughs was the grandson of the founder of the Burroughs office machinery empire, the man who patented the first practical adding machine - the mechanical bug runs in the family it seems. Abusive psychiatry also gets a send up.As Lee, Peter Weller has a face as impassive as a homicide cop almost regardless of the turmoil within (after all, he made the role of Robocop his own). But he is a \"tough guy\" on the point of melt-down. Judy Davis, looking just right, plays with plenty of conviction both Joans (who in Lee\\'s fevered brain are the same person). Ian Holm is good as Tom, the nasty older writer who is quite happy to lend his wife for sexual purposes but woe betide the man who damages his precious Arabic typewriter. Julian Peters as Yves radiated menace but overall was a bit of a cardboard-cutout, not helped by his dress and appearance, which seemed to have come straight from \"Brideshead Revisited\" (Sebastian in Morocco).David Cronenberg as a director has certainly got a reputation for weird films (\"The Fly\", \"Crash\") but this offering is relatively restrained It was something of a pity that \"Interzone\" was a studio set somewhere (Canada?) but this is low-budget stuff after all. Unlike the bugs in \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\", these ones have a story to tell, though it\\'s a painful one. Like Hunter Thompson, Burroughs was a great prose writer and the film has plenty of good lines. No-one could view heroin addiction with equanimity after seeing this film, but there is no moralising. As bug agent Clark Nova put it in the film:\"Just remember this. All agents defect, and all resisters sell out. That\\'s the sad truth, Bill. And a writer? A writer lives the sad truth like anyone else. The only difference is, he files a report on it.\" This film of \\'Naked Lunch\\' is the first of Cronenberg\\'s Trilogyof filming three of the most challenging literary works of the20th Century, and arguably the most difficult... as anyone who\\'sread Burroughs\\' 1959 novel can attest, in conventional terms itis a book without a cohesive plot or even structure, largelyassembled from the paranoid rambling letters of the world\\'s mostnotorious drug addict. Cronenberg\\'s approach to the material isingenious in that he attempts to fictionalize the circumstancesunder which the book was written rather than trying to weave astoryline from the mass of twisted plot threads which comprisethe text. The cast is impeccable, particularly Peter Weller and Judy Davis as the leads, Ian holm as a psuedo-Paul Bowles, and Cronenbergregulars Robert A. Silverman as Hans and Nicholas Campbell asKerouac-ish Hank. Julian Sands and Roy Scheider don\\'t quiteinfuse their roles with the ridiculousness of their counterpartsfrom the novel, but their cameos are brief and don\\'t detractfrom the overall effect. The overall effect being a hypnotic, schizophrenic blend ofbiography and folklore, equal parts Cronenberg and Burroughs, aself-tortured portrait of the creative process. To thedirector\\'s credit, he relies on the script (his own) and theperformances over visual trickery or stock travelogue scenery toset the mood and propel the action. The astonishing soundtrack,by the superb Howard Shore, underscores the drug-filled malaiseof this Tangerine dream perfectly... it lacks any musical senseof time and therefore hangs over the proceedings like amysterious haze. Haunting, powerful cinema... but mostdefinitely not for everyone. Wise up the marks before layingthis on them. New York 1953.  Bill Lee is a bug exterminator who follows his wife down the road of using the bug powder as a hallucinatory drug.  When he is picked up by the police for suspected drug use he is left in the cell with a large bug that tells him that he is on a mission and must watch his wife.  When he accidentally kills his wife he flees to Interzone to prepare his report, increasingly losing his grip on what is real and what is not.I have seen this movie several times and am always taken in by it.  In terms of narrative it is not the strongest film you\\'ll ever see.  In all honesty the plot is pretty thin and the film is best seen as a journey into destruction with Lee\\'s drug addled writer slowly but surely losing grip on reality with every passing moment.  The journey is reasonably interesting, even if it doesn\\'t have enough pace to really be fascinating.  What does hold the attention is the imagination of the film and it\\'s ability to put onscreen a decent representation of Lee\\'s hallucinations.The effects are very good but it is their use that is better.  While it does have a certain amount of gore, the creatures and hallucinations are actual characters (creepy characters at that) that are used well within the story, rather than just being effects or gore.  The cast can\\'t all say that and some of them are distinctly average at times.  Weller is as good as ever in a dead eyed performance that gives way to madness and fear at times. Davis is every bit as good, delivering two roles and be riveting in both.  Holm is OK and it\\'s not his fault that I couldn\\'t get Bilbo out of my mind!  Sands and Schneider don\\'t have enough to do but are interesting faces.Cronenberg is the perfect choice for director, but it is good that he holds back from the full on gore or body horror, call it what you will.  He uses a measured camera to film the hallucinations rather than using swinging `crazy\\' angles to portray mental state - that is a lazy technique.  Here Cronenberg (and Weller\\'s blank face) calmly and methodically fall into despair and it is good to watch.Overall, this is not a perfect film - it is slow and the narrative doesn\\'t totally grip, however it manages to make a good fist out of filming a descent into a hallucinatory nightmare.  Worth seeing it once, but I can\\'t imagine that the word `enjoyable\\' would really ever apply to this film. Mmmmm.... mugwump jizzThemes:  Substance addiction and how physically self-conscious it makes our protagonist feel, the creativity forced by imprisonment (a direct reference to real-life events between Burroughs, his wife, his subsequent incarceration and his heroin/acid issues), the sense of betrayal as more surprise than malice and of course the inevitable interface between Dave and Bill at the pelvic level.The effects work is pre render-mation latex and sufficiently restrained to allow your imagination to back-fill the appropriate horror/fascination/titillation for the moment.  Don\\'t try to figure out which you =should= feel or to mentally sort it out, that\\'d rob you of the fun; it\\'s the psychic and emotional disarray that makes it so compelling.Peter Weller is suitably deadpan, allowing only a sparkle of the playful poet to shine through from time to time (the story about the Duke du Vantra\\'s Espano-Suiza made me howl); he must have spent a few =fun= hours with Burroughs himself to get the role down.If you liked Cronenburg\\'s smarter stuff, such as Dead Ringers, you\\'ll love this.  If you\\'ve read Kerouac, Ginsberg or Burroughs in particular, I promise you\\'ll love it.  If you\\'re not into exploratory literature, have issues with distasteful realities of poverty or have a personal affection for the quality works of Stallone, Willis and Schwarzenegger - you\\'ll hate it.It made a very strong impression on me; the day after I saw the opening night of Naked Lunch (long before the \"internet\"), I established and sysoped a BBS that was the primary alternative discussion forum for onliners in Edmonton, Alberta for several years.  It\\'s name?  The Interzone.The movie is fascinating, odd, reveals more on second viewing, and is faithful neither to Cronenburg nor Burroughs but an excellent mix of elements of both.It has a great beat, easy to dance to... I give it an 89, Dick.Either way, you won\\'t look at a typewriter the same way ever again. I find it difficult to comment this movie, honestly. Without revealing anything, that is. This applies to comments only,as the evaluation would mostobviously be 10/10. You see, having read in one of the other comments here, that the movie contained an implication on heroin addiction, I expected to find something similar to \"Requiem to a Dream\" - a movie that leaves one single message and a bouquet of associated feelings in a viewer, with the message being DRUGS ARE BAD, in big friendly letters. I was wrong.I guess those who enjoy psychedelic music will understand what I want to say better - this movie has a high. Not literally of course, but it does leave you in a different world, with lots of ideas, without any definite beginning or end. It is very, very weird, in the most positive, awesome meaning of the word. Definitely not another conformist movie with a moralistic message behind it. Which is a good thing, really, because we don\\'t get a lot of that nowadays, and 1991 isn\\'t that far away....The only thing about it is that you either love it or hate it. Nothing in between.I find it quite impossible to add anything without revealing the plot. Therefore the only thing I\\'m going to say is: watch it! Not the best movie in the world, but most certainly the strangest one, at least from my point of view. A lot of people have already covered all the bases on why the movie is good. Now I\\'d like to express why the 37 dollar price tag is worth it.Firstly, the finest and most movie enhancing directer commentary ever made. Cronenberg and Weller are entertaining and informative, and they left me wanting to watch the movie again, equipped with a deeper understanding of this classic film. You also get a whole second disk of special features including hundreds of photos from the movie and of Burroughs and friends,The making of the movie, and Naked lunch read by Burroughs himself in all its obscene glory. This DVD is a class act and truly it is how any great movie should be treated. Criterion also uses the finest in today\\'s technology to restore and transfer the original masters to DVD. They went as far as to consult the director for his approval. The sound is also perfected to crystal clarity.In conclusion... You aren\\'t getting ripped off for 37 dollars. In fact, you are getting such an amazing deal it\\'s beyond words. Somebody told me to watch this because it would help me understand people taking drugs. I think I would have to be on drugs to understand it though, or maybe read the book. Maybe that was there point? Somebody also told me it was based on a book. Obviuously not the bibel. Well, anyway, I guess that explains why I didn\\'t understand it.Anyway, the movie is a comedy with a lot of scenes that remind me of my favoirite old time Walt Disney movies. There are typing talkwriters with flesh volcanoes for mouths and funny green aliens with slimy hoses coming out of their heads and European accents, and a lot of bugs. At least that\\'s what I think.I wanted to leave after about an hour, but couldn\\'t find my way out of the livingroom. I guess next time I will have to put together an exit strategy before I watch another weird one like this. God, I like Cronenberg. I like his commitment. I like his designs. I like the fact that he deals straight and heavy.I even like the feel of this movie while at the same time noting that it fails, at least it fails if you consider the value of the book.The book is one of many that deals with the sliding overlap between one reality and another. I welcome any of these. And this is particularly attractive because of the animate typewriters-become-agent-controllers. These are much more visceral in the film. But the book made much of the scintillating overlap, the typed page that touched the earth from time to time that we would literally hold in our hands to assure us that there was a reality.Cronenberg has none of this. As with all his films, there is one world, and he invests heavily in making it real. So we see ourselves, the typewriter that takes control, that provides the trance, the words, the enticement toward perversion of several types and its means. Cronenberg\\'s slip into alternative universes is slippery only one way; he won\\'t let us come home. I admire this, because I would rather see passion invested by an artist than compromise for something as trivial as effect. But here, I do miss the effect.Judy Davis is her usual sublime self. The character (actually two, sortof) is a mess and is never anchored. But she herself is, outside the film. Her character\\'s role is crucial to the thing, a sort of fulcrum around which the real and hallucinogenic revolve. Sex, meaning, holding onto the world. She accomplishes this not through the character, but the solid soul of the actress which shines through. Who else can do this? No one I know.Ted\\'s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching. Naked Lunch starts in New York City in 1953 where Bill Lee (Peter Weller) works as a bug exterminator, however he is having some difficulty as someone is taking his bug powder that he uses to kill them. Bill finds out that his wife Joan (Judy Davis) is taking it &amp; injecting herself with it, then strangely Bill is contacted by a large bug type creature that informs Bill he has to kill his wife Joan because she is an enemy agent. Bill flees New York City &amp; ends up in Morocco with his insect type writer that he writes his reports on, from this point on things get even weirder for Bill &amp; us...This Canadian, British &amp; Japanese co-production was written &amp; directed by David Cronenberg based on the controversial novel of the same name by William S. Burroughs, I am a fan of David Cronenberg &amp; his work in general but I have to say that I think Naked Lunch is his least enjoyable film as far as I am concerned. Cronenberg\\'s films are usually very visual &amp; have deep meaning &amp; are just great but Naked Lunch is a total mess that I personally didn\\'t get &amp; am not sure who it was meant to appeal to. Don\\'t get me wrong films don\\'t have to mean anything, they don\\'t have to have deep life changing messages or be thought provoking but Naked Lunch is an almost unfathomable film. The basic plot as far as I can make out is that some bug exterminator starts getting high on his bug powder &amp; then writes some bizarre book he titles Naked Lunch while having lots of bizarre hallucinations &amp; starts to suffer from severe paranoia &amp; concocts a strange world of his own in which he becomes some sort of spy or agent or something. For me a film has to be enjoyable &amp; entertaining, if it isn\\'t then what the hell is the point in watching it? Naked Lunch was neither enjoyable or entertaining to me so while some may love it &amp; find all sorts of obscure meanings &amp; parallels I thought it was just a meaningless mess with no direction or narrative &amp; at almost two hours long it felt like it went on forever. While watching Naked Lunch I just kept thinking \\'what the hell is going on\\' &amp; once it had finished I was left thinking \\'what the hell have I just spent two hours of my life watching\\', basically I was less than satisfied &amp; left totally cold.The film is stylish &amp; visually impressive as one would expect from Cronenberg, I can\\'t help but feel that it\\'s no coincidence that the orifice\\'s that the bugs speak out of look like a talking anus. There\\'s nothing in the way of horror or gore really, there are a few bug like creatures &amp; a couple of sex scenes but this is surprisingly tame considering the source material &amp; the director.The film has polished production values &amp; looks nice enough, Naked Lunch was going to be shot in Tangier in Morocco but because of the war that broke out in Iraq it ended up being shot completely in Toronto in Ontario in Canada. Apparently Peter Weller turned down the lead role in Robocop 3 (1993) to star in this, Ian Holm, Julian Sands &amp; Roy Scheider round off a good cast.Naked Lunch is a film that I didn\\'t like at all, there just didn\\'t seem to be any point or message or reason for it\\'s existence. As a big Cronenberg fan I can say this is my least favourite of his films that I have seen, over long &amp; meaningless pretty much sums Naked Lunch up for me. \"Exterminate all rational thought. That is the conclusion I have come to.\" A product of the Beat Poetry generation, writer and drug addict William S. Burroughs\\' 1959 Naked Lunch novel\\'s title takes it\\'s name as described best by the author: \"a frozen moment when everyone sees what is on the end of every fork\". The book was notably banned in many places and deemed unfilmable until Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg (Videodrome, The Fly) took the project into his own hands in 1991, adapting from Burroughs\\' other works as well to tell the story of this surreally strange science-fiction drama. Combining Howard Shore, known for his thunderous choir and full orchestra scores and Ornette Coleman\\'s dizzy saxophone of free jazz together for the film\\'s astounding score was certainly an audacious choice, as the notes sporadically swell and sway, seeming to add a hazy atmosphere to the drug-fueled ambiance of the picture. Peter Suschitzky\\'s queasy green-and-gray-tinged cinematography only adds to the collision of varying sensibilities of a sickly uneasiness as well throughout. Did Cronenberg succeed at filming the unfilmable? Let\\'s take a look. Peter Weller plays Bill Lee (a pseudonym of Burroughs and the name under which he published his first autobiographical novel Junky), a man of whom wants to write but exterminates insects to pay the bills. Bill sometimes hangs out with his nebbish writer friends, (of which Burroughs\\' modeled after fellow beat poet friends Jack Kerouac and Alan Ginsberg) Hank (Nicholas Campbell) and Martin (Michael Zelniker), of whom are both sleeping with Joan under Lee\\'s very nose. Lee\\'s wife, Joan, (Judy Davis), becomes addicted to Bill\\'s bug powder dust, as she describes a shoot-up to feel like a \"literary high\"; a reference to Franz Kafka\\'s 1915 short story \\'The Metamorphosis\\'. He soon joins her in a world of unorthodox hallucinogens, involving meeting the kindly but sinister Dr. Benway (Roy Scheider), walking away with his first dose of the black meat he gives to Bill: a narcotic made from the flesh of the giant aquatic Brazilian centipede. When a party trick game known between Bill and Joan called the William Tell routine involving a liquor glass and a gun go awry, accidentally killing Joan, Bill flees to the Tangiers-like Interzone (Burroughs wrote Naked Lunch in the city Tangiers). Here in this Mediterranean location, he encounters talking insectoid typewriters, double agents, offbeat aesthetes, Mugwumps spouting and oozing from phallic appendages and plots within plots.Cronenberg\\'s collaboration with the banned work of Burroughs between the realms of fiction and non-fiction allows the film itself to concern that nether region between the real and unreal as well, where the inspired and imaginative impetus for the creative process are not driven by drug-fueled hallucinations but are the product of it instead. With a fragmented touch of film noir realism, random routines and creepy-crawlies galore,\\'Naked Lunch\\' is a bizarre plunge into a narcotic delusion echoing that of a bitter cry from the bellows of the Earth. When combining both worlds regarding the exterminated species of the entomologic kingdom along with a few hits of insect powder, the thin line of what is tangible fades into a twisted oblivion, giving us a picture not for everyone but remains a good hit that still manages to shock and stun even today thanks to it\\'s daring director, even with all of the bugs and the drugs. Though this film is artfully made, it is a disturbing view with little if any redeeming reasons to watch. Lives filled with confusion, blindness and self destruction, careening into further fear and loathing is perhaps useful or even entertaining when it has a purpose. The reason for this film escapes me. Darkness and perversion and directionless unhappiness in a person\\'s life is not entertainment. Wow, this was one wacky and screwed up movie.  Maybe if I was a drug addict like the character in this film, I would have gotten something out if it, but unfortunately I am not a drug addict.  The story was completely unappealing to me, as were the characters.  Is there a point to all of this nonsense?  Apparently, but I could not find it in the mess.  I am sorry that I wasted my time on this weird and incoherent bunch of artsy fartsy gibborish.  The 6.4 rating should have hinted that this film appeals highly to one type of viewer and completely bewilders another type.  3/10.  Not recommend to the mainstream viewer, although others may love it.  Your call. This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I hated it so much I wanted to trash the theatre and burn the print of the movie. It was an excruciating experience from beginning to end.The only reason I was compelled to watch this piece of trash in it\\'s entirety is that I saw it in a cinema very far from my home, and I needed to catch my ride from the friend who was accompanying me. There was no where else to go in the area and, of course, no where in the lobby to sit and await my friend. I have never put myself in that predicament again.Do not watch this movie if you love yourself. Not for all tastes. Writer-director David Cronenberg\\'s appropriately-loose adaptation of William S. Burroughs\\' cult 1959 novel--his script inspired more by Burroughs\\' life than by his literature--this tale of a drug-addicted exterminator lost among perverted American expatriates in Tangier is satisfyingly grotesque for about an hour. Counseled (or rather, egged on) by demonic talking roaches, the exterminator takes to writing a book after accidentally killing his wife; fleeing New York City, he meets by chance his dead spouse\\'s lookalike and her husband, a quietly menacing homosexual with a typewriter fetish. Not particularly well-made, though Cronenberg certainly gained the trust of his actors and succeeds in not making them look foolish. Begins intriguingly but gradually loses steam, the shock factor having worn off. Judy Davis connects with the audience in an extraordinarily immediate way, but Peter Weller is too laconic to carry the rest of the weight. *1/2 from **** This is one of those movies worth warning watchers about, I\\'ve been interested by Cronenberg\\'s surreal settings and mastery at creating an unsettling aura, but bugs with \"talking anuses\" is definitely a good place to draw the line, this movie really pushes that agenda, very in your face, so if sexual ambiguity is not your bag you will be a bit bothered with about 50% or more of the film.I don\\'t know when it started happening in the movie but it all started looking like a set, not very impressed with that department or the special effects either, most of those bugs didn\\'t look too realistic, terribly plastic, but then again I\\'m not sure if this movie was intended to be quality cinema, it was probably more of an artistic whim This movie is not for the shallow. If you think all you need in life is material possessions, then avoid this movie. It will either bore you to tears, or hurt your personality.\"Naked Lunch\" is a ride into the mixture of 10% reality and 90% hallucination of a self-denial homosexual drug addict (Please note that I am not classifying this or any person or character like him - but merely listing all the qualities this character had). His struggle throughout his life - to admit to himself that he is homosexual is implied by his ability to admit the words in a hallucinogenic car ride but stonewalled inability to write the final sentence: \"I am a homosexual\" on his solo typwriter. Who is he afraid will see those words?... himself.E.g. he is sitting in horrific fear of the words he sees on the typewriter, yet when his typewriter turns into a grotesque \"bug\" he converses with it freely. This fear of self-realization culminates in his grotesque hallucination of two of his man friends in an embrace. This deep-seated fear is not explained but merely stated* and so is not a judgement on the writer\\'s or the director\\'s part about homosexuality - rather about this one character\\'s state of mind about himself. (I know the book is partly auto-biographical, but I am not talking about WB at all... rather of course about \"William Lee.\")The 10% of reality is that he sees himself in some small way as a writer. I suppose if you spend all your free time (albeit only 10%) thinking about and doing writing, then you could say you\\'re a writer... as well I am sure all the great authors did before they were \"discovered\" by the general public.So his life is loosely tied together (this is the 10% reality) by his writing. The rest is all one gigantic hallucination. You don\\'t know whether he is still in NYC (the car ride passes Morrocans and then New Yorkers where even a NYC subway entrance appears) or if he is in Morroco. It doesn\\'t matter. You want to know what he sees, does, says, and writes next. Somehow he manages to stay alive through it all.A \"co-plot\" (sub-plot seems like a poor word so I came up with \"co-plot\") is his relation with his wife. At least that\\'s what you think the relation is in the film - only a minor development - until you see the last half and the final scene. It all ties you straight back to the beginning when he was in New York City... and perhaps why he went \"travelled off\" to Morocco.= The Crew &gt; stated* ...and stated brilliantly by WB and Mr. Cronenberg who directed this film. BTW, if I were the producer I would ***never*** have given this to Mr. Cronenberg. The reason is because the list of his credits are for such movies as: \"The Fly,\" \"eXistenZ,\" \"Friday the 13th\" (the TV show!), \"Scanners,\" and \"The Dead Zone.\" While I saw each of them I only thought \"The Fly\" was entertaining. None of these projects proved Mr. Cronenberg to be the genius that he showed in \"Naked Lunch.\" I am in awe of his talent and salute him.Another thing that I applauded Mr. Cronenberg for was his augmenting the film with spots of undistilled reality - as when \"William Lee\" cries out to his now dead \"bug\" and then drops it to the ground - in the next scene it is the typewriter. (very dada - very cool - haven\\'t seen a \"dada\" in years! - thx for bringing me back to my childhood Mr. C! :) Scenes like this were used with the perfect amount of punctuality - to bring you back from the realm of riding out one of \"William Lee\\'s\" hallucinations, and back into the real world which \"Mr. Lee\" has almost completely left behind.Peter Weller as \"William Lee\" is so good in this film. I can\\'t imagine a better choice. The \"flat\" portrayal seemed to be perfect for a heroine addict. From what I have seen of other such roles, the loss of desire, passion, ambition, drive, ...even reality(?) is par for the course of these poor souls. I love Mr. Weller\\'s work - from \"Buccaroo...\" to \"Robocop\" and now \"Naked Lunch\" - he is clearly a thoughtful actor who puts all of his effort and thought into each role.Kudos to Ian Holm, Julian Sands, and Roy Scheider for their great support in this fine film by David Cronenberg. These guys are great actors. One could see how thoroughly they threw themselves into their roles.I loved this movie and will see it again and again when it shows on IFC. As Matthew Klickstein (another commentor) suggested, I will now try to read the book. (like seeing \"Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy\" it too requires seeing the British production *before* you actually read the books. I know because the book that wasn\\'t put into production was impossible to follow... and I have a very active imagination! :)OH! The meaning of \"Naked Lunch\" is the same as \"Clockwork Orange\" or \"Bug Typewriter\" - it\\'s like a thing you dream up in your sleep - or drug addicts see in their hallucinations... God help them.ZafoidPS: One commentor said that: \"If (you)... have a personal affection for the quality works of Stallone, Willis and Schwarzenegger - you\\'ll hate it.\" I disagree. I love a movie based on it\\'s own merits and impetus. Each can be enjoyed for their own qualities. E.g. People think that \"The Cable Guy\" was a bad Jim Carrey movie - not true. It was great because the guy was ***raised*** by TV! So his psychological afflictions stemed from his inability and lack of training on how to deal with real (3D) people... it wasn\\'t a movie about \"let\\'s see how crazy Jim Carrey can act\" at all.As I said - if you aren\\'t reflective person then this movie isn\\'t for you - nor any other thing that may cause you to shuffle the dust from the old breadpan! Luv\\' ya! :)BTW, \"kaiman\" (another commentor) got it ***EXACTLY*** right in very few words - nice job dude!I guess understanding this movie is like understanding (seeing the humor in) \"Pootie Tang\" - you have to have \"tasted it\" in some small way to have appreciate it.ZPPS: I took 1 and a half hours to write this comment - that alone should tell you how much I enjoyed this film. \\'\\'Naked Lunch \\'\\' is one of the most twisted and strange movies I already watched in my life. I didn\\'t get the story, and the movie don\\'t make much sense to me, even knowing that the story is based on real people and events from the life of Burroughs,like a biography.Even this movie being considered a Drama/Mystery genre, I think it should be a trash comedy, because some scenes are so pointless or without any sense, that they become funny! (The train of thought of this movie really does not have logic)The only actor I know from this movie is Ian Holm, who plays \\'\\'Bilbo Baggins\\'\\' in \\'\\' Lord of The Rings\\'\\'.Ps:The gay/sexual theme and the drugs\\' theme are present all the time, by the way. (In a metaphor being the \\'\\' bug powder \\'\\') I was really looking forward to this movie, based on the trailer and what I had heard about Burroughs\\' writing (never read it myself though). And with Cronenberg and a great lead player, how can one go wrong??Well, I tried hard -- twice, in fact -- but just couldn\\'t get interested in it enough to stay awake.  Cronenberg\\'s special effects were imaginative and well-done, but it just wasn\\'t enough to carry it off.  For me, at least.I don\\'t know what went wrong.  I did lots of drugs in the 60s, I love Cronenberg\\'s work and I really wanted to like this one. Maybe it\\'s me, but don\\'t get your hopes up on this one. See it when it\\'s free. i hated it! why? well, because it didn\\'t at all entertain me. i didn\\'t find anything amusing about this movie. why am i writing this if i hated it so much? i\\'m hoping to save some one a few bucks and buy something worth eating, like a burger.i read the other comments here for this movie and found a lot of people who liked it more than hated it (the rating is a little above average).  i was expecting a cool weird ride but all i got were bugs, BUGS, and more crappy bugs.  it doesn\\'t even deserve to be called \"weird.\" the whole junkies shooting up BUG KILLING POWDER was just lame.  i wouldn\\'t buy the typewritter bug fight for anything. to those who are homophobic, turn the other way and RUN.if it were possible i would have given this movie a zero, but i gave in and gave it a 1 for effort.  the main druggie character did have hallucinations which semi explained the irrational display of pure crap.  if you watch movie just for fun instead of watching movies to be a critic, this movie isn\\'t at all fun. i don\\'t know if it\\'s a movie that you have to be a certain age and over to understand. so, thumbs way way down and there aren\\'t even stars to consider for this movie. Cronenberg has proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that the Burroughs\\' novel \"Naked Lunch\" is in fact unfilmable. I have to give him credit for trying though. Cronenberg gives the film a bare thread of a story while attempting to retain the bizarre imagery and irrationality of the book. He wisely avoids the repetitive \\'sodomy followed by hanging\\' scenes that make up about half of the book. I am a fan of surreal and difficult narratives like \"The Machinist\", \"Lost Highway\" and \"Brazil\" but this one did not hook me. The emotional frame of reference and mood that makes those films so compelling is absent here. There are a few great lines in \"Lunch\" but most, if not all of those were lifted straight from the book. Cronenberg\\'s creatures are well made. Other than that this film is a waste of time. Of course in some circles it\\'s cool to like this movie (just like it was cool to like the book in college) whether you really get it or not.']"

       "'this film is not a feature film   for a start  it is not feature length  also  it is not shot on film   more importantly  it does not have what feature films have these days  star actors  special effects  exotic locations  explosions   instead  seeing b w p  is seeing something else that a cinema can be  a place where people can share an intimate experience created by a few people on a tight budget   i would be glad of its success if only for that reason the first section of the film appears at first to be amateurish and slow  in fact  it is very deft  and very efficient at what it does   it tells the audience everything it needs to know about the characters and situation  and nothing more   also  it gets the audience into the habit of viewing the film format  alternating between black and white  very grainy and poorly focussed  film  and the washed out colours of shaky pixilated video   the film makers managed to set up a rationale for why the film is so cheaply made   three people hike into the woods for a few days to shoot a documentary  with borrowed equipment  and are in the habit of videoing everything for the hell of it    they cannot carry tripods  steadicams  dollies  large lighting rigs  or the like  so everything we see is lit either by raw daylight  or by a single light fixed to the camera  which illuminates just what is within a few feet of the lens   the film creates its own excuse to be cheap   this is intelligent the acting and script are both excellent   the well cast actors are presumably playing pretty much themselves  and are convincingly naturalistic  and neither too likeable or too dislikeable   the slow route into hysteria is well documented   rather than simply having a character say  we re lost    we see many scenes which show the trio getting more and more hopelessly lost  and more annoyed with each other for this   by the time they are thoroughly lost  the audience shares the despair my friend and i  after seeing it  both felt a little sick   i put this down to my having been tense for a hour  he put it down more to motion sickness  the jerky  badly framed camerawork is hard on the eye and stomach  but i applaud the director for its uncompromising use   similarly  no compromise is made with the dialogue   some of it is very quiet and must be listened for  some is technical jargon  which is left realisticly unexplained one of the great strengths and weaknesses of the film is the editing   it is good in that it does much to heighten the tension  with many key moments lasting just a little too long for comfort   each time the characters find something nasty  the viewer is made to want the editor to cut soon to the next scene  and the fact that he doesn t adds to the sense of being trapped  as the characters are   the problem with this  though  is that one is left wondering about the motives of the fictional editor   in truth  of course  the film is edited to create these effects  and to entertain  but the film rationale is that these are the rushes of a documentary put together posthumously by someone other than the film original creator   why  then  would an editor piecing together such footage  edit for dramatic effect rather than for clarity   why would he keep cutting back and forth from the video footage to the film footage  when neither shows any more information than the other the film is stark   after one simple caption at the start  all that follows is the  rushes    i wonder if the film might not have been improved with an introductory section which documented how the rushes were found and edited  a programme was made for television which did this   perhaps a portion of this might have been added to the film  making it more complete  and more believable  and proper feature length  while i applaud the fact that young original film makers have managed to create a mainstream hit out of a simple idea  well handled   i dread the possible avalanche of inferior copies which may come most horror films these days are created not for the audience  but for the makers   the departments of special effects  make up  model making  animation and so forth all try hard to show potential future employers what they can do   the result is that nothing is left for the audience to do  since everything can be seen and heard  and the viewer imagination can be switched off   today  it is possible to see pigs fly on the screen  and so film makers show off and show us a formation of tamworths  which is something which will look impressive in the trailer   to show us less is to make our minds fill in the gaps   this way  we create our own terrors  perfectly fitted to ourselves   the ghastly face i see in my head  is the ghastly head which i find scary   the ghastly face i am shown may be one i can cope with quite easily   if i see a believable character screaming in hysterical fear at something i cannot see  my own brain creates demons for my night dreams  demons far more mighty than anything cgi graphics or a latex mask could portray this film will stay in your thoughts for some while  i saw this film last night  long after all the hype and reviews were made about it  i settled in with the right mood for any film  no expectations  if you expect too much  you may be let down  take note for any kubrick film   i watched the entire film without interruption and came out with a great feeling   the blair witch project  is one darn good movie many critics and moviegoers complained about the film for its length  its amateurish photography editing  and its lack of adequate acting  i feel these things made the movie  first  the film has to be at most ninety minutes long  any more  and it would be too long and boring  second  the amateur video take gives the audience the feel that they are actually in the woods  listening to the rippling water of the creek  snapping branches under their boots  and hearing things go bump in the night  i greatly admire the use of two video cameras  one black and white  the other color  to denote which character is shooting the film  lastly  the incessant screaming of whiny heather  the constant complaining of average joe mike  and the dudley do rightness of josh make for great acting  yes  these are regular people and up and coming actors from your local community theater  but you know them  you ve met people like them the biggest complaint  however  comes from the film supposed  lack  of scary moments  this film reminds me of the classic horror film  the texas chain saw massacre   and though not as gory and as shocking as that film   the blair witch project  shows just enough fright in the group search for a way out of the woods  stalked by people and or things they may never understand  in the older film  the long interval between opening credits and first gory act of violence is about thirty minutes long  it is even longer here  but the suspense fright  just as in the older film  begins right from the opening credits  you just don t see it until the film over  these are three people out to make a documentary in the woods with handheld camcorders  these are real people  and great actors  heather whines a lot and screams and reminds you of the girl you hate so much you fall in love with her  her screams sound real  her cries are genuine  and she is deeply deeply sorry for bringing the others into the woods in order to film her documentary i really dig the beginning  it seems so real to me i may delve into my old home movies for nostalgia  heather and josh pick up mike  then go to the store for supplies  this opening sequence really packs a punch  these are three generation xers out for a camping trip  we all know what happens to them  but we re glued to the screen  intent to know what actually happens the interviews give us some detail into the blair witch legend  but most of the audience is too busy thinking about the actual trek into the woods that they don t listen  this is wrong  listening is good  the interviews  which also sound real and not rehearsed in any way  are like movie reviews  the critics tell you what they saw  but mostly they don t want to ruin it for you   unless they hated it and that what i ll do  i won t ruin it for you     i think i know why blair witch has generated as much negative as positive responses   it forces you to become involved in the movie going experience wow   what a concept   instead of sitting there like the passive sponges most of us become when going to the movies we are actually expected be become involved   take a leap of faith belief or whatever and delve into this movie   without the overpowering f x and music score most movies rely on to care  you  if you still have an imagination left what is implied becomes a hundred times scarier than anything offered up by hollywood in the last  years   the hardest thing in movies is to scare you   not make you jump out of your seat with  watts of sound blasting at  decibels  ever seen the  version of the haunting   event horizon    every potentially tense scene is preceeded by dead silence then the blast    wake up people   blair witch is the horror movies we have been needing for a long time and i m glad someone finally had the guts to make it  like most movies  whether or not someone likes tbwp will usually depend on what they re looking for   many people enjoy horror movies because of the special effects  gore  shocks  and  in some cases  the high production value   since tbwp came from a small independent film company that cost less than a hundred grand to make  can a moviegoer really expect all that and have a good time   i honestly don t think so myrick and sanchez had a terrific idea for a film  make a frightening mock documentary that was supposed to look like it was done by some amateur college students   some people seem to be under the impression that the movie was about the witch  when what it really was about the mental and emotional breakdown of the three film students   i feel that once viewers could accept the low production values and the improvised script  only then could they deal with heather  josh  and mike   until they do that  the film would never work for them i just put myself in their position   i m lost in the woods  i m tired  i m hungry  and i ve got the added stress of returning borrowed equipment   the weather is getting colder  it rains just enough to make life miserable  and something is waking me up each and every night   now  i m exhausted  grouchy  scared  and i having troubles thinking clearly people might have hated heather because they she was bitchy and annoying  but all three of them had their moments  good and bad  many people might have also hated the fact that not everything was explained to them  and that they never got to see the blair witch   many other people may have resented artisan entertainment marketing campaign  although they can t deny just how effective it was   all the filmmakers and actors asked was that filmgoers understand the spirit that was intended  without it  they knew the film couldn t work for anybody as you might already tell  i thoroughly enjoyed this film   what haxan films managed to do with what they had is not only revolutionary  but is also inspirational to independent filmmakers everywhere   i found the backstory interesting  the plotline well thought out  and the characters extremely developed  considering the lack of structure and guidelines within the film  if you do decide to see this film  i think you ll enjoy it if you see it for what it simply is  nothing more  it might even scare the hell out of you  privileged to see a preview of this fantastically terrifying film  i found myself actually feeling the pain and mind numbing anguish of the characters  at times in the movie  i would find myself trying to peer through the darkness with them  fully realizing that there was absolutely no chance of knowing what was out there   i think that is the most effective aspect of this  the fear of the unknown   i really can t think of anything more frightening than something that has no identity  and so you don t know how to relate or react  and you are forced to suffer through the unknown   a key component also included in this film was the steady decline of human spirit that you witness first hand   you watch as the characters are broken down to small  scared  hunted animals  and you find yourself shaking your head at how pitiful and helpless they have become  yet you don t feel sorry for them  only agonizing hope that they will escape the fear with at least their lives   wonderfully created film that  at least for me  an outdoor enthusiast who used to enjoy wandering alone through familiar woods  will always haunt me to the core of my soul when i look around and see nothing but endless woods  unknown sounds  and things that are never seen  with all the hype surrounding this new independent horror film  you might think it would be hard for it to live up to expectations  the blair witch project is probably as scary as it reputation  feel free to read on  i do not intend to give away any of the film secrets or surprises  the less you know about this creepy little chiller  the better filmed on video and  black  amp  white  this film is exactly what the horror genre needs in a time reminiscent of the early  slasher onslaught  the blair witch project has no knife wielding maniacs  no dna altered monsters  and no real bloodshed onscreen  we see what the three film makers see as they make their way through the deep  dank woods in search of a legendary witch  there are times when there is nothing but a black screen  and all we can do is listen to their scared voices and the unexplained noises going on around them  the true horror behind this film is the unknown  and those dark places where you know something is lurking if you are a seasoned veteran of the horror cinema  the blair witch project may be less frightening than for someone who has not seen many scary movies  you will have to respect it originality  and it manipulation of our deepest fears  at times the film really makes you feel the sense of dread the film makers are experiencing  one thing i did notice about the audience in the theater is that everyone was very quiet  except for an occasional gasp  the moviegoers were absorbed in this film  that unusual for a modern horror movie  most are full of fake scare tactics and multiple twist endings that keep the audience shouting and screaming at the screen  one thing for sure  you can expect many imitations of the blair witch project in the future  isn t that how it usually goes  hmm  wow  what is there left to say  i ve waited for most of the hype to die down to even add my comments for this movie to imdb  and here they are this is really a movie that has polarized a lot of people  many love it and consider it the best thing since sliced bread  and plenty more absolutely hate it and call it tripe  drivel  awful  wretched  the worst ever  etc   note  as far as i m concerned  the opinions of anyone calling any movie the best  or even more especially  the worst  movie ever are to be immediately disregarded   highly innovative in its way  it spawned many parodies and an interesting but inferior sort of sequel  in the summer of star wars  episode   this was the movie that originated several cultural symbols i saw this movie shortly after it opened in wide release  sitting in a theater surrounded by my friends with popcorn in my lap and watching mike and heather run around some creepy old house  i felt for the first and last time in my adult life  real  creeping fear  when i myself was not in danger many have complained about the shaky cam  the cussing  how nothing  really happens   and that it not scary  by and large  the camera is not  that  shaky  at least to the point where you can t understand why  they re tromping through the woods and they re scared half to death  i must not get queasy very easily  as i had no problem with it  as for the cussing  the lines were ad libbed  the actors are college age  and all three sound exactly like every american college student i ve ever known  so maybe people have a problem with young peoples  language  but what else is new  that not a flaw of the movie  it realism and part of why so many more young people found tbwp scary i think at least some of the dissention in opinions is caused by generational and cultural differences  my mother friends told me it wasn t scary  but that  psycho  terrified them   psycho   while interesting and a classic  is not the least bit scary to me   the excorcist  has only a couple scenes that i find frightening  but my mom breaks out in goosebumps at the mere mention of it  the scariest thing i ever saw until i watched this movie was a reel in a collection of horror shorts  a woman walks into her house carrying groceries  drops her keys down her heating vent  bends down to try to get them  and something grabs her scarf  she struggles  but within a minute or two  she drug down and strangled  the scarf goes slack  the woman is lying dead on her floor  and that it tbwp is about what you  can t see   about how your fear of the unknown is so much worse than what the unknown could probably ever be  the characters were not even necessarily likable  but they were  familiar   heather is the girl i sit next to in film class who thinks she has all the answers  their mundane existence  captured in the beginning of the film  roots them in reality  what happens to them is terrifying because they are so every day  so interchangable with millions of other college kids  and  finally  you never know whether the witch exists or not  everything that happens can be explained away by coincidence  pranksters  bats  hunger  exhaustion and imaginations run wild with fear  or you can choose not to explain them away young americans are not scared of much  school shootings can roll off us like water  the evil human beings inflict on each other is run of the mill  o clock news  we are raised in a culture that claims to worship a vengeful  elitist god while almost everyone is hypocritical and uses the power of spirituality as a way to abuse others  we are in information overload from birth  what we fear is not knowing  and in the black hills woods of maryland  just beyond the flashlight reach  something is making strange and terrible noises  but we don t know what it is  i ve never seen the tide turn on movie reviews before like i did in the blair witch project  first  i heard this movie was the scariest movie since the exorcist  then i heard it was the worst movie of the year  when people thought it might be real  they loved it  then  when everyone found out it was fake  i heard all sorts of bad things about it the blair witch project is about three young filmmakers  heather donahue  michael williams and josh leonard  actors with same names as their characters   go out into the woods of burkittesville  maryland to do a documentary on the mythical blair witch  they are never found  but a year later their footage is discovered  and it seems to indicate that there really was a witch and it was stalking these three filmmakers i did not find the blair witch project especially scary  although it was rather spooky  i did think it was good  with an excellent and very original plot  the acting in this movie by the three young kids was very good  especially if the rumors about how they improvised most of it were true  the character development was well done  and you will often find yourself waiting for daylight along with the characters was this movie overhyped  a little  but i think if it wasn t that it wouldn t have been as successful  since the actors  writers and directors are relatively unknown  they did a very good job and i hope to see more works from them in the near future sure  some of the realism could ve been better  even i knew that they should ve followed the stream out of the woods instead of going deeper into the forest  and if this was happening to me  i doubt i d pick up the video camera and tape it all instead of running like hell  but it still worked  i think the scariest part is how you don t see as much as you hear  because often the sound is  times worse than the thing making the sound this movie isn t too scary  but if you watch it in the middle of the night with all your lights off and alone  it will successfully freak you out  it worth a rent or a buy  judge for yourself  this movie scared me in a way that no other has done before   i remember going to camp as a child  and hearing things outside at night   that was scary enough   this movie recreated that entire scenario and then added some to it   the fact that those things that go bump in the night outside your campsite were real in this movie makes it more nerve inducing and frightening   as anyone  the first time i set foot in the ocean after seeing jaws for the first time  i was nervous   let me tell you in order to get from the movie theater to my house  i have to drive through the woods  after seeing this movie  that drive got significantly longer  more eerie  and scared the heck out of me   i went about  mph all the way home in order to get out of the woods   this is one scary movie  i spent about an hour and a half sitting around in my living room on halloween waiting for something   anything to happen   just when i thought it was coming to the big climax at the end in the house  nothing happens    big surprise this movie is a complete waste of time  there is nothing scary about it unless you find filming shots of the woods  watching swearing teens  listening to a high pitched annoying girl voice  that was pretty scary   watching film from inside a tent with cheap sound effects playing outside  or watching a wobbly camera run through the woods at night  cant see anything   then you should skip this movie   if i was out in the middle of the woods  i too would decide to throw away my only way of finding my way around  my map  this movie had a weak  if any plot   this movie was one of the biggest let downs i have ever seen  and i ve seen  batman and robin  i ve never seen bwp   but it anything like this movie  it will be equally bad if not worse  because i would have to waste another  minutes of my life  i ve seen worse movies  but not many   yes  i like horror films   yes  i can distinguish cheap  sensationalistic splatter horror from from the more chilling  show less and frighten more variety  and i prefer the latter to the former  i still hated blair witch   i don t lack imagination  but this movie certainly did   i ve seen tampax commercials that filled me with greater fear   the film lacked wit  style  story  plot  suspense  or verve   i don t need expensive cinematography or stellar acting  but a film does need something to redeem itself  other than a sophomoric  if marginally clever  idea   and this film did not have it it is unfortunate that a bad movie has come to represent to many the epitome of independent cinema   for a real horror masterpiece  see ringu  the ring   which  though it was probably filmed on a larger budget  worked because of talented direction and great storyline  is there   because if there is  i want to see it   i went to see this movie because all my friends told me that it would scare me   i ve never been even remotely frightened by a movie before   this movie didn t even come close to scaring me   it was so unbelievably asinine and stupid that i can t believe it even got picked up for distribution  much less called  great    i can t believe it made the amount of money it did   i should have demanded a refund   let put it this way    if i took a few of my friends into the woods  with a video camera  and made scary noises at them so that they could pretend to scream  it would undoubtedly be scarier and superior to this movie   i m sorry  but those  blair witch  noises sounded exactly like someone playing a prank on them   a waste of my    this is the worst waste of film i have ever witnessed in my life  i cannot fathom what people who loved this movie are thinking  wow  the  actors  seem to be talking off the cuff  the script  if there was one  lacked any imagination or anything clever to say   movies that have parodied this crappy movie do a better job of conveying fear  i understand the premise  of course  make the movie appear like a home movie where some young people encounter some weird and horrific experiences  the problem is  most vacation home movies are more compelling and clever  whenever there was a hint of tension  the actor would swear or scream  for lack of anything better they could think of  this film experience was memorable to me and those who watched it with me  for one reason  it is easily the worst i have ever seen  it makes  freddie got fingered  look like  gone with the wind   which is where  blair witch project  should go  if you are looking for something to scare you  look somewhere else  this is the worst excuse i have seen for a horror film  the style of shooting was as expected  shaky hand held camera  which fitted the premise of the film  but you felt like you were watching an amateur film by school kids rather than actual footage of a real event which it was supposed to depict normally i expect a horror to get my heart racing a few times  and have some surprises  but the plot was too obvious  there were no surprises  nothing that would make you jump i would not recommend this to any film buff  ignore the hype and skip this film  well i hated this movie the first time  so one year lated i rented it again to see  what was i missing    well i am missing a brain for thinking that it might improve with age or a second time aroundit doesn t      as a matter of fact it gets worse i don t get the big deal          it is not scary  not entertaining  does not hold your interest  it does not have good characters  it does not make you think   it isn t even mindless fun it is just stupid and annoying and a complete waste of time   i guess one can never underestimate the taste of the public at large   this movie deserved to make   i still think the entire budget of the movie went to beer and pizza   and twigs and rocks made me save money by not going to see blair witch   a film which fell foul of its own publicity machine   the blair witch project  was abhorred and derided by the mainstream film going public which it became unfortunately directed at due to its extraordinary and outlandish marketing campaign   the blair witch project  is not a typical film that the typical cinema going public would normally be exposed to  the camera work is jerky  the dialogue repetitive and inane and the action virtually non existent  at times confusing  annoying  irritating and tedious  this film is nonetheless a brilliant piece of arthouse experimental film making  this movie is virtually all style there hardly any plot  no real action  no semblance of a real script and one that works on a deeper psychological level than the standard mainstream horror film  indeed  only the very last image in the film is truly frightening  and only if it can be correlated to an incident at the very beginning  the rest of it only becomes scary afterwards  when the audience has had time to consider what they ve seen  it is groundbreaking  manipulative cinema made without a script  with an amateur cast and with little or no post production values  this is a remarkable film which can only really be appreciated  if the accompanying hype is overlooked  as a unique  avant garde art film and not the regular hollywood stock it was presented as to the public  i d confidently say that this film has got to be one of the biggest movie swindles ever perpetrated on a completely unsuspecting audience with a devilishly clever publicity campaign to fuel its release  the blair witch project  tbwp  for short  became the  most successful  indie  film of all time  grossing nearly   million  its success was surpassed in  by my big fat greek wedding directed by eduardo sanchez  tbwp is presented as a documentary pieced together from amateur footage and filmed in real time  tbwp was shot in a matter of just  days and all of the dialogue was  pretty much  improvised tbwp tells the tale of  young film students who hike out into the black hills near burkittsville  maryland to film a documentary about a local legend known as the blair witch the viewer is told that these  students were never found  although their video and sound equipment  along with the footage they shot  was discovered a year later in my opinion  tbwp completely fails to deliver on all counts  trivia note    throughout the course of the story the word  fukk  was spoken  times  with this film having a running time of  minutes  that averages out to about one  fukk  every  seconds  if you thought that  star wars episode   was the most over hyped letdown of the year  get ready    the blair witch project  is so shockingly bad it could have been made by your ninth grade brother friends on their first camping trip this summer   shot primarily with a poor quality video  which appears to pre date steadyshot    blair witch  should have had a hard time getting into student film and video festivals based on the poor visual and sound quality alone   instead  it has won prizes and accolades at both cannes and sundance  and has become the new indie darling of film critics most everywhere  but   blair witch  is far scarier than many of the critics have even begun to hint at   it basically  minutes of watching amateurs stuck in flat woods  running in circles  with no concept of shot composition  no script  no performance talent  and absolutely no idea of what the hell they are doing   this is the movie that puts the  horror  in horrible  blair witch  is supposed to be about the making of a documentary   is this supposed to represent a documentary film crew  a girl who is a complete bitch  and two dweebs who act like whiny versions of beavis and butt head  the interminable fits of yelling and screaming will have you bored stiff  do stick figures made of wood  and the sounds of nearby  filmmakers  making funny noises in the woods give you the creeps    if so  you might actually find this frightening well  as audiences everywhere are finding out  as cinemascore is indicating    the blair witch project  is not a good film  and certainly not what they were told it would be   shame on critics making comparisons to horror classics like  the exorcist  and  the texas chainsaw massacre   those were bold masterpieces of terror in which the scripts were solid before production began   jeez  even  i still know what you did last summer  was scarier than  blair witch   if jennifer love breasts get any bigger     any dolt can do what the makers of  blair witch  have done  just look at the worst home videos your neighbor larry has in his collection  but larry knows how to use that tripod his wife bought him last xmas  to quote bart simpson from that great halloween episode with poe  the raven    do you know what would have been scarier than nothing                      anything    contains spoilers in berkeley  the blair witch project generated a lot of a certain type of buzz that will often make me wary and i avoided seeing it during its first run  suspecting that i d feel the rip of an eight dollar ticket  after having screened a vhs copy acquired at yard sale videos  i still feel that way a little but not because i didn t like it  seeing it in a theater would have precluded being able to really watch a film like this the way i prefer to do i had to stretch a bit to get past some aspects of the film setup  the self filmed documentary approach can t quite carry the movie weight through its entire length  some sequences could not have been filmed by any of the protagonists  as was the implication  yet there they were  no one among the three  film makers  could have managed the presence of mind  in the midst deep panic  to have filmed heather running screaming through the dark woods  it was all too far out of pre established character  although the image is certainly indelible  but even a dodge dart with a brown door will get you there if it keeps running and once past my initial hesitations  i was forced to admit that the blair witch project is very effective there are moments when blair witch has the dankness of silence of the lambs and the raw  twilit scariness of the opening few minutes of night of the living dead  in my opinion one of the great horror sequences  i became a true believer at the point where josh and mike began to realize that something was very wrong in the crackling burkittsville woods  that they really had to get out  and were ramping up to full freak while heather simply refused to stop filming although there was really nothing to film  this sequence nailed perfectly the deep frustration one can feel under the sway of a relentless know it all  especially when said person is female and  thereby  largely immune to the more primordial forms of conversation reserved for males  josh and mike  aggravated and frightened as they were  still could not abandon heather  who had become more of a liability at that point than an asset  both had begun to succumb to the stress of walking the razor edge between being scared squat less and being unable to admit it the blair witch project has an unassuming  almost sneaky way of getting to you  first off  the main characters are not at all likeable  which in itself is fatiguing  josh and mike are types that might be found at loose ends on any saturday night  marooned in a mall or mini mart parking lot  heather is an almost cute  soon to be overweight  classic candidate for domestic violence at the hands of a future husband or boyfriend equipped with no sense of humor  or of the ironic  a few minutes with them and you are more than ready to burn out from slogging the monotonous autumn woods where night  freed from the shackles of daylight savings time  comes too soon and remains too long  when the exhausted trio takes to its sleeping bags  you re right with them  then  you re suddenly wide awake for all the wrong reasons  the sound of fracturing wood  out past a wall of darkness on which strong flashlight beams pile up like pizza dough  are not just twigs being snapped  they re branches  big ones  but this conclusion is never verbalized by any of the trio  one of the three refers to the sound as  footsteps  but only if the feet are size  american  it left up to us to fully grasp the implications the three principal actors are  essentially  playing themselves and all perfectly manifest the giddy hubris reserved for those who may be able to come fifteen times a day but possess just enough knowledge and experience to be dangerous  but playing one self may be harder than it looks and they do so with conviction  most notably the tough minded  endlessly irritating heather  her character may be packing the only real cojones in the bunch and when she finally begins to unglue near the end  you know the doo doo has gotten very deep  it not mere post adolescent  cheeseburger craving discomfort any longer  that trifle has been left far behind  somewhere back under the decaying leaves  heather runny nosed  video self portrait  made upon realizing that she and her companions are in far  far over their heads  is truly poignant  we may enjoy seeing vain  clueless teens get theirs in slasher movies but the blair witch trio  three somewhat loosely wrapped goofballs trying to pull off a film making project  are really not clueless in the classic sense nor are they stupid  they ve just intrepidly placed themselves in a very wrong place for which there may be no possible right time and finally the ending  which is really what this film is all about  almost everything you ever feared in your youth  both in the light of day and dark of night  is compressed perfectly into the film last few seconds  when the evil suggested throughout finally thunders down like stagnant water through a breached dam  the result is possibly the most viscerally disturbing horror sequence ever produced  all exploding skulls  bursting rib cages  and dangling intestines ever filmed are mere confetti alongside its simple  implicit power  only the discovery of the maternal corpse in the basement  in psycho  even comes close  keep the little ones away from this one  mom and dad  a child mind will have no defense  nowhere to run  and most disturbing  nothing tangible to run from  only an invisible  meticulously goal oriented malevolence that comes from nowhere  and everywhere  at once  some observations anyone who thinks this movie is scary has lived a sheltered life  indeed those who gave this dreck anything higher than a    probably bought pet rocks when they were on the market this flick will go down in history as another  billy jack    remember it was getting high ratings for the first few years  as far as one of the producers saying he noticed people vomiting after having seen the movie  they were probably made physically ill at having thought of being ripped off like they had been this flick sucks beyond words     this one is like the fable about the emperor and his new clothes  he didn t have any  and the blair witch doesn t have any  this thing was awful  i wanted to like it  i expected to like it  i tried to like it  i came away hating it  i saw this thing three times  and while it got a great idea  and it not terrible for a student film say  it far far too long and boring for the one trick it got to pull  i simply am at a loss as to how so many people can allegedly have loved this thing  as anyone who has read my reviews for any length of time knows  i don t kiss ass when it comes to independent films  if it a good film  i rate it accordingly  if it a bad film  i do likewise  however    it become one of my pet peeves that indie film fans demand that every independent film be called nothing short of a masterpiece no matter how mundane it is  no compromise  it this mentality that has resulted in my extreme dislike of indie films and their fans and filmmakers  honestly  just because something was made without studio assistance and or interference does not automatically make it a masterpiece  any more than having the hot new centerfold of the month makes the next michael bay film an oscar contender  yet  still the indie zombies insist that it does  supposedly this mentality comes from resenting hollywood excesses  such as taking away artistic control  bloated budgets  inattention to casting appropriate actors in favor of popular ones  and worst of all  annoying marketing campaigns  what bs indie films are guilty of many hypocrisies  but attacking marketing campaigns is their biggest  as endless marketing hype along with pure stupidity is the only reason anyone would have seen this clunker i m currently reviewing i can recall  quite vividly  the endless pop up ads  the fan sites  official and supposedly unofficial  magazine articles  tv  specials  the merchandise  the relentless tv  commercials  whew  the people who complain about the  dark knight marketing campaign just plain weren t alive to not know the extent of this films marketing which makes sense  since    of all the negative tdk reviews i ve seen couldn t have been written by someone older than  or    tdk had nothing on this film relentless marketing campaign trashing hollywood for over hyping their products  then doing the same  that the definition of hypocrisy  that alone would be justification enough to dislike tbwp and it indie film moron cult and to call them hypocritical and give the film a  rating  even if it was a good movie  even if i had liked it the fact that it also sucked as a film anyway just justifies my rating the common defense is that this is some brilliant  art film  which introduced the concept of not showing the monster and leaving it to the imagination  bs  val lewton did the same thing a thousand times better during the    with films which are classics of the genre   cat people    the seventh victim   etc  and in   probably the best of all  unseen  horror films  robert wise a disciple of lewton   the haunting  was released  to borrow an indie film fan phrase  it pwned  blair witch   all classics  all achieving their suspense without showing the monster  all before this film but indie fans ignore all this  they claim those movies don t count because they are old and in black  amp  white  typical response from them  no respect for older film as for the tory  of this film and it qualities  i wouldn t even give it a d if it was a student film  the device of not showing the monster comes off less as an artistic choice and more an excuse to film nothing but a couple of dumb asses running around and passing it off as a film  i ll admit it clever  heck  even lewton originally adopted the device out of necessity  but he did it mostly because he recognized it dramatic potential in the face of several alternatives  for the record  it is also a complete and utter rip off of a much better film called  the last broadcast   the difference being that there is a survivor  really  otherwise it the same damn thing  and it the indie film fans who call hollywood unoriginal if only i could use the eye roll emoticon  the story also sucks   cannibal holocaust  did the  found footage  thing much better  the  acting  is also awful  it so forced you wonder if the witch is a legitimate legend even in the context of the story  the praise for characterization is true  though  i definitely felt something about the characters  i wanted all  of them dead within a minute  and even if  pray tell  the device of not showing the monster was original  or had been used well  does it really matter if it an awful film otherwise  nope  at best  it just revives a long dead gimmick and for all the people who say it must be good because so many people thought it was real  let me ask you something  have you ever heard the phrase  idiots will believe anything   grow up and watch some atmospheric   unseen  horror films that are actually good  this is no different than your usual incredibly stupid  vapid hollywood slasher flick with annoying teenage victims  only without a slasher and not made by hollywood  but still incredibly stupid   vapid and filled with annoying teenage victims       this comment contains spoilers     as a fan of movies and horror films for  years  i ve seen a lot  and i have to say that bwp is a totally amateurish piece of junk to call this a  film  is laughable  it has no plot  no ending  no story  it is the  minute rambling of some dunderhead carrying around a hand held camera filming everything he sees  this movie was made by loading some film  getting some nobodies together  going to the woods and shooting enough film to make up  minutes  no film was left on the cutting room floor  every worthless scrap was included  the ineptitude and total lack of film making skills is astounding  i used to think robot monster was the pits  bwp is worse here is what happens in the  film   three dimwits find a tape made by three nitwits who supposedly uncovered the blair witch and were never seen again  the three dimwits head into the forest to investigate  along the way they hear weird noises at night  find some sticks hanging from trees  get lost in the forest  start to cry because they are so scared  in the end one of the dimwits wanders into an abandoned shack and the last scene shows him trying to look scared into the camera  the end  that all folks  i m not kidding  that the movie in these times when anyone has access to equipment to make a movie  bwp proves the theory that any talent less person can make a  film   bwp was the biggest movie marketing scam in history  it proves p t  barnum  there a sucker born every minute   by using the internet to lie and hype the film  the cynical lug heads who made this suckered people in  as they say in the used car business   for every seat  there an ass   i was one of the asses who got suckered  using the same  based on a true story  technique as the amityville horror  bwp lured well intentioned moviegoers into the theater  if bwp were a car then it would be subject to a  lemon law  and you could get your money back  unfortunately  the movie business doesn t work that way  those of us who lost our    on this scam have no recourse  the only recourse i have is to slam this piece of trash in this review  which i hope i have done  why i detest bwp so much is because it was such a shameless scam that showed utter contempt for movie goers  this was not a film  it was just a mechanism to cheat people out of their money i would rather watch robot monster ten times than ever see bwp again  after seeing the bland witch project  now i can understand why so many people ran from the cinemas screaming   they wasted   for nothing  this fictional documentary within a pseudo documentary form may be the most overrated  under financed piece of film to come down the pike in a long time  where is the suspense  where is the involvement  where is the identification  the spectacle of three film student types traipsing off cluelessly into an unfamiliar forest with a reported history of gruesome violence is just plain stupid  we know from a printed foreword that the three young film makers are doomed  and by the time i got to know them a little i didn t much care what happened to them  is the blair witch project a masterful ghost film or a gimmick to create a multi media event   it is both   the picture  shot on super  video and  film displayed in a squared  documentary like frame  is quirky  annoying  and spectacularly scary   the scenes at night quite frankly scared the hell out of me   the gimmick that the blair witch project is created confusion and wonder over whether or not the footage shot was real life   now  we all know the truth  but the french term  cinema verite  is defined by this grisly film a guaranteed cult classic  blair witch has  heather  mike  and josh  heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of maryland looking for the blair witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills   for most of the film  it is very unclear   the beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are a  experiencing the supernatural  b  being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople or c  just completely out of their minds   its up to the viewer to decide but my money is on option a most filmgoers know that the filmmakers sanchez and myrick used their mac cards and cookie jars to put this phenom together and i commend them   this is a tour de force thriller that does indeed seem real   its all improvised and  verite  like and the best part about the movie many chills are based on the basic premise that scares most of us   we are generally frightened by what we cannot see   many times throughout the film  the screen is completely dark with sudden bursts of screams and grainy scenery   for the sake of the suspense  the film may have been better if we did not know the gimmick   the realism is sometimes smothering true  the hand held camera can make you achy in the head  but the way the actors play off each other is magic and not for the faint of heart   i viewed the film on dvd with someone who was not feeling too well because of the dizzying camera  but somehow the black and white and color and rain blend together and allow myrick and sanchez to do what they were attempting to do   spooking an audience with unseen forces is so effective and i was reminded of robert wise original the haunting from  with the groans and the cries and the shrieks   a baby giggle can be heard during one spellbinding scene when the tent the  students sleep in takes on a life of its own much has been made about a similar film made in similar fashion by some other young auteurs well before the blair witch project was released   i never saw it and if it was as good as this film we would ve seen it  nonetheless  this past summer shocked and surprised me with the amount of good horror pictures around   in the woods  no one can hear you scream either rating      '"
